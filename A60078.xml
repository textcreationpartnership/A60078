            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Several Hiſtories of <hi>France, Portugal, Caſtille,</hi> and other Nations have very much laboured to finde out and diſcover from what Countrey, and what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50649:7"/> Houſe this Prince HENRY deduced his Original. His extraction ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been unknown for a long time, and concerning which there hath been almoſt as many Opinions as Writers. Some have written that he deſcended from an Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> others from a King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſome from <hi>William</hi> Count of <hi>Bourgongne,</hi> brother of <hi>Raymond</hi> Count of <hi>Outre-Soane,</hi> and others alſo from <hi>Guy</hi> Count of <hi>Vernoeil</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> brother of this <hi>William.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aux Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez de la Gaule Belgique.</note> Furthermore there are that report, that he was ſon of <hi>Henry,</hi> Duke and Earl of <hi>Limbourg,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Lorraine.</hi> Laſtly, others (which have followed the Error of <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Vaſſebourg</hi> a Modern Hiſtorian) are of Opinion that <hi>William</hi> was his Father, who was called Baron of <hi>Joinville,</hi> whom they make to be Governor of <hi>Lorraine</hi> in the abſence of his Father the great <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Buillon</hi> elected King of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all theſe Opinions, and Imaginary deſcents, have been worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by <hi>Theodore Godefroy</hi> Advocate in the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> in a Treatiſe which he hath publiſhed of the Original of the Kings of POR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUGAL; having firſt revived this Opinion, and clearly juſtified by proofs and undeniable reaſons, that they are deſcended in Line Maſculine from the Royal Houſe of FRANCE by this HENRY the chief of his Branch.</p>
                     <p>And he groundeth principally upon the Authority of the Fragment (which yet remaineth) of an old Latin Hiſtory of <hi>France,</hi> which begins at the deceaſe of King <hi>Robert,</hi> and is continued to the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt; An Hiſtory compoſed by a Monk of the Abbey of Saint <hi>Benedict Lez Fleury</hi> upon the <hi>Loir</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who lived in the time of the ſame HENRY; This Fragment (with other Hiſtorians) hath been publiſhed at the end of the laſt Age by the Learned <hi>Peter Pithou.</hi>

                     <p>Now was King SEBASTIAN in the Twentieth year of his age, who being of an able Body, and of a Couragious, and Martial Soul, not content with thoſe Dominions which he poſſeſſed, reſolved to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of new, not conſidering, that this deſign was not to be effected, without great hazard, and in the alteration of that repoſe his Kingdom had ſo long enjoyed. He had firſt deſigned a War againſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> but that his Kinſmen and Subjects would not conſent unto. But as there was ſome difficulty wholly to withdraw the young Prince (who had a Warlike ſpirit) from this Enterpriſe, ſuch as were near him, laboured to divert him by means of another which they laid before him, turning all his Reſolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Affrick,</hi> to engage the <hi>Moors</hi> which live in that part called <hi>Mauritania Tingitana,</hi> where the <hi>Portugals</hi> maintained (to their great Charge) upon the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> the three Fortreſſes of <hi>Septe, Tangier,</hi> and <hi>Magazon,</hi> the In-let and Key of <hi>Spain,</hi> by which the <hi>Moors</hi> have heretofore conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; But this diverſion whereunto they perſwaded the King, produced ſad effects, principally proceeding for want of Judgment, for although it were difficult wholly to diſſwade him from the expedition of <hi>India,</hi> and therefore convenient to repreſent unto him ſome other Action; yet ſhould they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly have foreſeen, not to divert him from one miſchief, to thruſt him into a greater.</p>
                     <p>The young King ſtayed not long to put this deſign in execution. For in the Year, <hi>One thouſand five hundred threeſcore and fourteen,</hi> he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <label type="milestone">

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50649:44"/> ſo diſquieted his conceit, that he neither ſaid nor did any thing to other end; deliberating not as a King, but as a private Souldier, to accuſtom his body to labour, intending thereby to habituate himſelf more to the hardſhips and miſeries of War. This inclination (in which the heavens had ſome part) was not contradicted by any of his Council; For although theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kings were raſh, yet Ambition, and fear of his diſpleaſure, were of ſuch force, That the Nobility, Magiſtrates, and other perſons (who might have forced him) durſt not open their mouths, nor oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt his Will; and if any did mutter or ſpeak to the contrary, they were men of baſe Quality, and not admitted.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And the more to enflame King SEBASTIAN, it fortuned that <hi>Muley Mahomet</hi> chaſed out of the Kingdom of <hi>Morocco</hi> by his Uncle <hi>Muley Moluc,</hi> endeavoured his re-eſtabliſhment by the aide of the Chriſtians;<note place="margin">Errera.</note> and for this purpoſe entreated ſuccours from SEBASTIAN, perſwading this King, that by the advantage of thoſe Friends that he could make in his own Kingdom, he ſhould be able to defeat <hi>Moluc,</hi> and to open him a way to trace the whole Empire of <hi>Morocco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>SEBASTIAN drawn on by this vain hope,<note place="margin">Vaſconcellius.</note> embraced the <hi>Moors</hi> offer, and finding himſelf not able to perform this expedition without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confederate, endeavoured to draw into this Action his Uncle by the Mothers ſide, the King of <hi>Spain, Philip II.</hi> to which effect an Interview was appointed at <hi>Guadalupa;</hi> There the Kings met,<note place="margin">Nonius.</note> and propoſals were made of a match betwixt King <hi>Philips</hi> Daughter, and King SEBASTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN, and as to the War of <hi>Affrica,</hi> the Spaniſh King liked well of it, ſo that it might be proſecuted by his Lieutenants, but not that he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it in perſon, excuſing himſelf that he could not aſſiſt him with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force, pretending he had occaſion for Souldiers to reſiſt the <hi>Turk</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> ſo that from the Catholique King he could expect but ſmall ſupplies.</p>

                     <p>With this Fleet ANTHONY, with ſome few <hi>Portugueſses,</hi> ſet Sail out of <hi>England,</hi> having before aſſured the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> That the <hi>Portugueſses</hi> would revolt from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and appear for him; and that <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> would ſtrengthen him with Twenty thouſand men.</p>

                           <p>THe People Claimed, <hi>Jure Regni,</hi> alledging, That the Iſſue-Male of their Kings failing, the Election belonged unto them, fortifying this Reaſon by the Example of the Election which was made of their King, <hi>John I.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But againſt the People it was anſwered, That they had no greater Priviledge of Election in this Kingdom, than in the reſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> all which Realms fall by Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when there is any lawfully deſcended of the Blood-Royal: And that in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> they have leſs Liberty than the reſt, growing from the Gifts of the Kings of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille,</hi> and from the Conqueſt of the Kings of <hi>Portugal.</hi> And foraſmuch as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not give the Realm to their Primative Kings, they could not ſince be inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any Power to Chooſe one. And for that which they alledged concerning the Election of King <hi>John I.</hi> it was anſwered, That this Reaſon did ſo little ſerve their turn, that it was rather an Argument againſt them, to prove that the Kingdom in that Caſe was Succeſſive: having themſelves ſecretly confeſſed, That they had no Right to Chooſe, whil'ſt there remained any one lawfully deſcended of the Royal Iſſue; Inferring, That <hi>Beatrice</hi> being married to a Stranger, The Realm was in the ſame eſtate, wherein according to the Law of <hi>Lamego,</hi> they were to chooſe the next Prince of the Blood; which Choice proceeded from Duty, rather than any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50649:51"/> unlimited Power in the People. But to put this Diſpute out of doubt, there had been Four ſeveral Examples put in Practice againſt the Peoples Election.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Alphonſo III.</hi> Succeſſor to his Brother <hi>Sanceo II.</hi> left the Crown to his Son <hi>Dionyſio,</hi> by the Right of Inheritance. 2. <hi>Emanuel</hi> in the ſame Right ſucceeded <hi>John II.</hi> his Fathers Brothers Son. 3. <hi>Emanuel</hi> upon his journey into <hi>Caſtille,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That if he deceaſed without Children, the Succeſſion did belong to <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> his Siſters Son. 4. And <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal in the ſame manner without Election ſucceeded <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> to whom he was great Uncle. So that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, That Cuſtom was to be obſerved in the Succeſſion of a Kingdom, which had been ever practiſed.</p>

                           <p>But againſt the moſt Chriſtian Queen it was pleaded, That her Pretention was improbable, and preſcribed, ſeeing that the Succeſſors of the Earl of <hi>Buillon,</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made any mention thereof, neither is it credible, that ſince this Pretention was incorporate to the Crown of ſo mighty a Realm, ſuch Wiſe and Potent Princes as were <hi>Francis I.</hi> and <hi>Henry II.</hi> would have forgotten to call it in queſtion. But the truth was, the Counteſs <hi>Matilda</hi> left no Children, as it appears in her Teſtament, in the Publick Regiſters of <hi>Portugal,</hi> making therein no mention to leave any by King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> nor to have had any. It was likewiſe proved, That <hi>Matilda</hi> or <hi>Maud</hi> had no Children, by a formal Requeſt found in the ſame Regiſters, by the which all the Prelates in the Realm did beſeech Pope <hi>Urban,</hi> That it would pleaſe him to diſannul the Curſe which he had laid upon the Realm, and that he would approve the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Beatrix</hi> the ſecond Wiſe of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that he would make their Children Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, that there might be no hindrance in the Succeſſion of the Kingdom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was concluded, That if there had been any lawful Children of <hi>Maud,</hi> they could not have perſwaded the Pope to preferre the Baſtards of <hi>Beatrice.</hi> It was added, That theſe Reaſons were not unknown in <hi>France,</hi> and that of late there had been a Book Printed, of the Genealogie of the Houſes of <hi>Medicis</hi> and <hi>Buillon,</hi> continued unto <hi>Katherine</hi> the moſt Chriſtian Queen, whereby it did clearly appear, That <hi>Maud</hi> left no Children by <hi>Alphonſo</hi> her ſecond Husband, having been formerly married to <hi>Philip</hi> Son of <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> by which Marriage ſhe had one Daughter named <hi>Jane,</hi> who did not ſucceed her Mother in the County, dying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her without Iſſue: So as <hi>Robert</hi> Son of <hi>Alix</hi> Siſter to <hi>Matilda,</hi> came to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50649:51"/> and this is that <hi>Robert</hi> from whom they would draw the deſcent of Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> being the Nephew, and not the Son of <hi>Maud.</hi> So as not being at all proved, that <hi>Alphonſo III.</hi> had any Children by his firſt Bed, but the contrary by many Reaſons, the Queen had no Reaſon, they ſaid, to Pretend.</p>

Againſt the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> it was not denyed, but that he preceded the Catholique King, and ſo conſequently the Duke of <hi>Savoye;</hi> but as to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> ſhe pleaded, That <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucio</hi> could not aid himſelf with the benefit of Repreſentation, being the Son of her Siſter deceaſed, and therefore out of the degree wherein the Laws allow it.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut it was no Arguments could confute, or annul the certain and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable right of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> which was clear to the World, both by her Deſcent, and by the Fundamental Laws of the Nation, and this King PHILIP knew well, and therefore, though he carried on his affairs very candidly to the eyes of men, and ſeemed unbyaſſed with proper Intereſt, by offering to ſubmit his Title to a Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, profeſſing, That the Laws of <hi>Portugal</hi> were more favorable to him, than the Law of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and openly acknowledging, That if he ſhould chance to die before King <hi>Henry,</hi> his eldeſt Son being a degree farther off, would come behind ſome of the Pretenders, of whom himſelf had the precedence. Though, I ſay, he carried himſelf thus fair to the World, yet he clandeſtinely wrought with Father <hi>Leon Henriques</hi> a Jeſuite, and Confeſſor to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinando Caſtillo,</hi> a Dominican, and of the Kings boſom Councel, to endeavor by all means poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to divert all Deſigns in prejudice of his Claims, and eſpecially that <hi>Catherine</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> might not by <hi>Henry</hi> be declared to be the next Heir apparent; which he, conſcious of the juſtice of the Title, was very willing to have done.</p>
                     <p>And whileſt theſe two Fathers proſecuted his intereſt there with the old, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt doting King <hi>Henry,</hi> the vigilant PHILIP provided an Army in readineſs, with which he reſolved to enter into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and with his Sword make good his diſputable Title, as ſoon as that old Kings death ſhould give him the Warning-piece to fall on.</p>
                     <p>Yet when that was given, and PHILIP ready to march with an Army of Twenty thouſand men into <hi>Portugal,</hi> he had like to have been prevented; for Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth pretending ſtill his right to Diſpoſe, or at leaſt to Arbitrate all Difference concerning that Crown, had ſent Cardinal <hi>Riario</hi> Legat Apoſtolique, with Order to diſſwade the Catholick King from raiſing Arms, and that done, to paſs into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and in his Holineſs name and behalf, to Arbitrate the Right between all Pretenders; which deſigns of the Popes, this crafty Spaniſh Fox circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for having pre-advice of it, and reſolving to purſue his own intentions of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to himſelf the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and yet approve himſelf an obedient Son of the Church, he gave Order in all places where the Legat was to paſs, he ſhould

                     <p>But to proceed to the manner of his poſſeſſing himſelf of this Kingdom: No ſooner did the News arrive at the Spaniſh Court of the death of King <hi>Henry,</hi> but <hi>Ferdinand de Toledo,</hi> Duke <hi>D'Alva,</hi> was commanded with an Army of Twenty thouſand men to march toward <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> and in the Name and Right of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty, to make Conqueſt of the Kingdom, if he found oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>But all the appearance of oppoſition which he found, was made by <hi>Don Antonio</hi> the Baſtard-ſon of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Infante, who having got into <hi>Lisbonne</hi> in the Head of a tumultuary Rabble, rather than a well-formed Army, endeavored at firſt to make ſome reſiſtance, but was ſoon diſcomfited, and the Suburbs of <hi>Lisbonne</hi> being ſacked to ſatisfie the Souldiers, the City was ſurrendred to him, whither ſoon after the King came, and ſo by a mixt Title of Deſcent and Arms, took poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, <hi>Ao</hi> 1510. <hi>Katherine</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> being enforced to ſurrender to him all her intereſt and pretenſions; which you have read at large in <hi>Anthony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Nobility and People of <hi>Portugal</hi> were, without doubt, extreamly amazed to ſee themſelves ſo ſuddenly ſurprized, and made Subject to a Forein Prince, and eſpecially to a Prince of that Nation, againſt whom they had a natural Antipathy: but finding themſelves in a condition not able to make any reſiſtance, they thought they ſhould gain more by ſubmitting freely to that King, than by being forced to it; and therefore they made their humble ſubmiſſion, which PHILIP met as it were half-way, and condeſcended in the General Aſſembly of Eſtates, to be ſworn to theſe Articles or Capitulations following.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. <hi>That the ſaid</hi> PHILIP <hi>King of</hi> Spain, <hi>&amp;c. ſhould obſerve all the Laws, Liberties, Priviledges, and Cuſtoms granted to the People by the former Kings of</hi> Portugal.</item>
                        <item>II. <hi>That the Vice-King, or Governor, ſhould be alwayes the Son, Brother, Uncle, or Nephew of the King, or elſe a Native of</hi> Portugal.</item>
                        <item>III. <hi>That all chief Offices of the Church or State, ſhould be beſtowed upon the Natives of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and not upon Strangers; likewiſe the Governments of all Towns and places.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>IV. <hi>That all Countries now belonging to the</hi> Portugal, <hi>ſhould ſo continue, to the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and benefit of the Nation.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>V. <hi>That the</hi> Portugal <hi>Nation ſhould be admitted to all Offices in the Kings Houſe, as well as the</hi> Caſtillians.</item>
                        <item>VI. <hi>That becauſe the King could not conveniently be alwayes in</hi> Portugal, <hi>he ſhould ſend the Prince to be bred up amongſt them.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Theſe Articles were ſhut up, or concluded, with a Bleſſing upon ſuch Kings as ſhould obſerve and keep them, and a Curſe on thoſe who ſhould break or violate them. And ſome Authors likewiſe affirm, that there was another Clauſe added to them, ſignifying, <hi>That in caſe</hi> (which God forbid) <hi>that the King which then was, or his Succeſſors, ſhould not obſerve this Agreement, or ſhould procure a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50649:54"/> for this Oath, the Three States of the Kingdom might freely deny Subjection and Obedience to the King, without being guilty either of Perjury or Treaſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though theſe Articles were thus ſworn to, and the Cardinal <hi>Albertus</hi> Archduke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Son to the Emperour, and Nephew to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> appointed Vice-King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> PHILIP the Second durſt not in Perſon yet leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for he perceived by their Murmurs and viſible Diſcontents, that their Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, proceeded more out of Fear, than Love; and that as he had in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gained that Kingdom, ſo he ſhould as ſoon loſe it, if he ſhould but give them the leaſt opportunity.</p>
                     <p>For that the People were highly diſcontented, might eaſily appear by their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive liſtning after old Propheſies, among which, was one of an old Hermit, who told <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Portugal, Of the great Victory that he ſhould obtain over the Five Kings of the Moors; that he and his Poſterity ſhould Reign happily Kings of</hi> Portugal, <hi>but that in the Sixteenth Generation his Line ſhould fail, but that God at length ſhould have mercy again upon them, and reſtore them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others had reſpect to a Letter written by St. <hi>Bernard</hi> to the ſame King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> (the Original of which is reported to have been given to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſadours, by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth King of <hi>France, A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> One thouſand ſix handred and forty one</hi>) the ſubſtance of which was to this effect: <hi>That he rendred thanks to him for the Lands beſtowed upon him, that in recompence thereof, God had declared unto him, That there ſhould not fail a Native of</hi> Portugal <hi>to ſit upon that Throne, unleſs for the greatneſs of their ſins God would chaſtiſe them for a time; but that this time of Chaſtiſement ſhould not laſt above Sixty Years.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Other Propheſies there were of this Nature, and to this Effect, which put the People in hopes of a Deliverance, and many of them flattered themſelves, That <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was yet alive, and would come and deliver them; nay, ſo fooliſh were ſome of them, that though they believed him ſlain at the Battel of <hi>Alcacer</hi> in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary;</hi> yet they thought he ſhould live again, and miraculouſly come to redeem them.</p>
                     <p>But that which moſt of all expreſſed the Peoples Diſcontents, was, what was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſpoken by the mouths of their Oratours, the Prieſts in their Pulpits, who would ordinarily in their Sermons utter Speeches much in prejudice of the Spaniards Title, and in Favour of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza;</hi> nor were they ſparing to do ſo in the preſence of the King himſelf, who would therefore often ſay, <hi>That the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez Clergy had made the ſharpeſt War with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Lewis Alvarez</hi> a Jeſuite, preaching one day before the Vice-Roy, took his Text, <hi>Surge, tolle Grabatum tuum, &amp; ambula;</hi> and turning himſelf to the Duke, ſaid, Sir, the meaning of that is, <hi>Ariſe, Take up your Pack, and be gone home:</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all this, might the Diſcontents be perceived in the Noblemens Chappels, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi>'s, where they were wont to ſing the <hi>Lamentations of Jeremy,</hi> applying all the ſcorn and reproach of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to themſelves; as <hi>Aquam noſtram pecunia bibimus;</hi> becauſe of the Excize put by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon Wine, and other Neceſſaries: And that, <hi>Servi Dominati ſunt in nos;</hi> and that, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit Corona Capitis noſtri;</hi> moſt commonly ending with this Invocation, <hi>Recordare Domine, Quid acciderit nobis Intuere &amp; reſpice opprobrium noſtrum: Haereditas noſtra verſa eſt ad alienos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet did King PHILIP bear all theſe Affronts with an incomparable Patience, diſſembling with an admirable Prudence his Paſſion (if he had any) for theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents; for he knew, the only way to win this Nation to an Obedience and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, muſt be Lenity at firſt, whatever he intended to practiſe afterwards; and that he had by his exact keeping of his Word and Oath, won much upon this People, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that during his whole Reign, and the Reign of his Succeſſor, PHILIP
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50649:55"/> the Third, who followed his Fathers foot-ſteps, though not with that Craft and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, they made no Attempts, nor were inclinable to a Revolt.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Attempts made by <hi>Anthony</hi> (which you may read in his ſtory) and ſome ſmall buſtles with one or two Counterfeit <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> not worth mentioning, were the only ſtorms, that hapned in this Kingdom during the reigns of PHILIP the ſecond, and third; for they keeping their words in moſt things, though ſome of their priviledges they infringed, had almoſt brought the people to a willingneſſe to be their ſlaves, whereas PHILIP the fourth committing the whole charge of the Government to Count <hi>Olivarez,</hi> (who though without doubt an able Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet would ſeem to have a way in policy by himſelf, which no body elſe could underſtand the reaſon of) loſt the whole Kingdom, and all its Territories.</p>
                     <p>For ſuch was the new rigorous ways which he would preſcribe in the Government of <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> both people very tender of their Priviledges, the leaſt breach of which ſhould have been ſeconded by a potent Force to have ſuppreſſed them, in caſe they ſhould attempt an Inſurrection, when inſtead of having ſuch power in readineſs, the <hi>Catalonians</hi> had rather opportunity given them to rebel, and ſpurs to provoke them to make uſe of the opportunity; for ſome Souldiers being ſcatteringly quartered among them, but too few to curb them, they looked upon that as a greater intrenchment upon their Liberties than any before, and a deſign utterly to enſlave them: wherefore converting their patience into fury, they took Arms, maſſacred thoſe Souldiers, ſlew their Viceroy, and put themſelves under the <hi>French</hi> Protection.</p>
                     <p>This Revolt of the <hi>Catalonians</hi> was a preſident to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who had extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered under the breach of their Priviledges: for contrary to the ſecond Article ſworn to by King PHILIP the Second, which ſaid, <hi>That the Viceroy or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſhould be either Son, Brother, Uncle, or Nephew to the King of</hi> Spain: The Infanta <hi>Margarita di Mantoua,</hi> who had no relation at all to the Kings of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> was made Governeſs, which they might, and perhaps would have born, had they not been incenſed by a more feeling injury <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. when the Tax of a fifth part was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon all the Subjects of that Kingdom; an intollerable grievance, and thought ſo inſufferable by the Southern parts of the Nation, that they roſe in Arms to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and had ſet the whole Kingdom in a combuſtion, had it not been timely quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the timely care and induſtry of the then Governeſs, the <hi>Infanta Margarita</hi> of <hi>Mantoua.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet this ſmall ſtir gave an <hi>Item</hi> to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the readineſs of the people to revolt, which made <hi>Olivarez</hi> endeavor by all ways poſſible to cut off the means of their being able to do, but whileſt he endeavored to prevent them, he gave them the means to do it, though he failed not to make uſe of thoſe courſes which in probability might enſure that Kingdom; the chief of which was, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to allure from thence the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> whom the people of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> looked upon as the perſon who of right ought to be their King, and who was the only Native of the Kingdom who might reſtore again the Line of <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> beſides, he was a Prince, who for Power, Riches, and Number of Tenants, not only exceeded all the Nobles of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but even of <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was one of the moſt glorious Subjects in <hi>Europe,</hi> being allied to moſt Kings in Chriſtendom; which made the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> though they were Competitors for the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> treat this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily with more honor than any other of his Grandees, receiving them almoſt with as much reſpect, as if they were Soveraign Princes; which appeared in PHILIP the Second, who moſt of all deſired to abaſe this Family, yet would always when the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> came to viſit him; meet him in the middle of the room, and not permitting him to kiſs his hand, ſeat him with himſelf under the Canopy of Eſtate.</p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:50649:55"/>
                     <p>To draw him therefore out of that Kingdom, <hi>Olivarez</hi> firſt politickly offered him the Government of <hi>Milan,</hi> a place of great truſt and honor, but he modeſtly refuſed it, as not in a condition at that preſent to undertake ſo great a Command, and indeed expreſſing an unwillingneſs to go out of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But his unwillingneſſe to go from thence, made the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> the more willing to draw him from thence, it was therefore given out, That the King himſelf was reſolved to go in perſon to reduce the revolted <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> and that therefore all the Nobility ſhould be in a readineſs in four months time to attend his Majeſty in that Expedition. But the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> being ſuſpitious of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe he knew himſelf ſuſpected by them, and likely to be, whil'ſt the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> ſo much affected him; to aſſure himſelf of the ones Love, and to avoid (if poſſible) the others Suſpect, retires himſelf to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-houſe at <hi>Villa-Vicioſa,</hi> and there follows his Sports of Hunting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not at all regarding matters of State, withal ſending an Excuſe to Count <hi>Olivarez,</hi> That his Affairs at preſent were in ſo low and mean a Condition, that he could not appear to attend his Majeſty in that Pomp and Splendor that became a Perſon of his Quality; and that therefore he ſhould do his Majeſty more Service in ſtaying at Home, when the other Nobles were abroad, than he could poſſibly do by attending him.</p>
                     <p>This Plot thus failing, made the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> more ſuſpitious of the Duke than ever before; Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> therefore reſolves to employ his utmoſt Art of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation to entrap him, which he ſets upon by a Fetch ſo far about, that to the eye of Reaſon, it might put the Duke into ambitious Thoughts of endeavouring to aſſume his Throne, and in a way to accompliſh thoſe Thoughts, rather than any way preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice him; but it appeared afterwards that <hi>Olivarez</hi> Deſign in ſo far truſting the Duke, was only becauſe the Duke ſhould truſt him.</p>
                     <p>In Anſwer to <hi>Braganza</hi>'s Letter of Excuſe, the Count aſſures him that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was very well ſatisfied with his Reaſons of not attending him in the intended Expedition againſt <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and that he was very ſenſible of his good Inclinations to his Service: That for his own part, he was very ſorry that his Affairs were in ſo low a Condition; for he could not but Commiſerate his Intereſt as his own. That his Majeſty, to let him know how great Confidence he repoſed in his Fidelity, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him General of the Militia of that Kingdom, and had for his preſent Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, ſent him Sixty thouſand Crowns, leaving it to his Choice to reſide in what place near <hi>Lisbon</hi> he pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>This ſtrange Confidence put in the Duke by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> much amazed the greateſt Polititians, who thought it reaſonable, That the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Duke ſtill to have kept retired in the Countrey, rather than to have given him ſuch a Command, and called him to <hi>Lisbon</hi> into the continual View of the People, who looking upon him as the Heir of that Houſe which had ever been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to have the only Right to the Crown, might eaſily be inflamed with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have a King of their own.</p>
                     <p>And theſe things was the Princeſs of <hi>Mantour</hi> very ſenſible of, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſollicited the King to know his Reaſon, or to deſire him to remove thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Opportunities which he had given the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> to effect a Revolt: But ſhe not only received intricate and enigmatical Anſwers from the King, and Duke <hi>D'Olivarez;</hi> but likewiſe had the former Actions ſeconded with one, which made her of Opinion that his Catholick Majeſty had a mind to toſs the Kingdom into <hi>Braganza</hi>'s hands whether he would or no; for on a ſudden, without any notice giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to her, all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gariſon in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Caſtle, which commanded the City of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and indeed upon the ſtrength of which, the whole ſafety and ſecurity of the Kingdom depended, were ſuddenly drawn forth, and the Caſtle left to the diſpoſure of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Braganza.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:50649:56"/>
                     <p>But this was the laſt Act of Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> Confidence in the Duke; for by truſting him ſo much, he now thought that he could not but reciprocally repoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him; and therefore next Summer, <hi>A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred and forty:</hi> He again by Letters ſollicites him to leave <hi>Portugal,</hi> and come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> firſt telling him, That his Catholick Majeſty gave him many Thanks, and greatly applauded his Loyalty in the Exerciſe of the Office of General, and was very ſenſible of the good Effects which his Authority had wrought over the <hi>Portugals.</hi> Next he repreſented unto him the preſent declining Condition of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy; not only by Reaſon of the Diſorders in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and the preparations of the <hi>Turk;</hi> but more eſpecially, for that their moſt potent Enemies the <hi>French,</hi> were now in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Revolted <hi>Catalonians,</hi> entred into <hi>Spain:</hi> That it highly concerned his Catholick Majeſty to drive theſe out of his Territories, which could not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but by a very powerful Force; that he being one of the prime Grandees of the Kingdom, might by his preſence in the Head of a good number of his Tenants, encourage others to a ſutable Aſſiſtance, that to that purpoſe his Catholick Majeſty expected him every Moment, having deſigned for him great Honours, Priviledges and Dignities ſutable to his Merit.</p>
                     <p>But as cunning an Angler as <hi>Olivarez</hi> was, yet he failed of his Mark, the Bait would not yet hook in the Fiſh; for though the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was accounted no very great Polititian, yet his own Safety taught him to know that all theſe Truſts, and fair Promiſes, were but gilded Allurements to draw him to his Deſtruction; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore ſupplied the King with a conſiderable number of his Tenants and Friends, he found Excuſes for his own not going in Perſon; and to take off all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition of Jealouſie or Thoughts, that he had any Deſign againſt the State, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again to his Countrey-houſe. Thus did theſe two great Perſonages by Craft and Diſſimulation, endeavour to ſupplant each other, only the one ſtrove the others Deſtruction, the other only ſtudied his own Safety and Preſervation.</p>
                     <p>During all theſe paſſages, the Vice-Queen <hi>Margarita</hi> of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> was very vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in her Government, and foreſeeing what in Reaſon might be the iſſue of theſe proceedings, wrote very importunately to the King, aſſuring him, That if it were not ſuddenly prevented, the Kingdom would infallibly be loſt. To which, his Majeſty returned her no Anſwer; and <hi>Olivarez</hi> in his ſlighting her judgment (as fitter to Govern a private Houſe, than a Kingdom) deſired her, That if her Capacity would not reach to the height and drift of thoſe Myſteries of State, yet that her Wiſdom would prompt her not to diſcover them.</p>
                     <p>Yet without doubt <hi>Olivarez</hi> was inwardly perplexed to ſee all his Plots thus fail, and foul means he durſt not openly attempt, ſuch was the Dukes Potency, and the great Love the People bore him; he therefore at laſt has Recourſe to Treachery, and to that intent gives ſecret Advice to <hi>Don Lopez D'Oſſis,</hi> and <hi>Don Antonie D'Oquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> That when they had relieved <hi>Flanders</hi> with Men and money, they ſhould with the whole Fleet put into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and then as ſoon as the Duke ſhould according to the Duty of his new Place and Office come aboard, they ſhould immediately ſet Sail, and bring him away to <hi>Cales:</hi> But this Plot was by a ſtrange Divine Providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; for that Fleet was totally Routed by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> in the Year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred thirty and nine.</hi>

                     <p>For although the moſt Illuſtrious Infanta <hi>Margarita</hi> of <hi>Mantoua</hi> was a Princeſs of great judgment and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in State-affairs, yet ſhe permitted her ſelf to be ſo much over-ruled by <hi>Vaſconſellos</hi> Secretary of State, or at leaſt was ſo much over-ruled by him, whether ſhe would or no, that he either by ſome ſecret conſent of his Catholick Majeſty, or led on by his own ambitious ſpirit, confiding in the great favour he had at Court, never permitted the <hi>Infanta</hi> to enjoy other than the title of Vice-Queen.</p>
                     <p>And inſufferable was the Government of <hi>Vaſconcellos</hi> to the <hi>Portugueſſes,</hi> who as much hated his obſcure Birth, as they did his evil Cuſtoms: He was a man wholly compoſed of Pride, Cruelty, and Avarice, that knew no moderation but in exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: ſmall lapſes were by him made capital crimes, chaſtiſing with all ſeverity thoſe whom he did but ſuppoſe diſſatisfied with his Government; And exerciſing with

                     <p>Some have been of opinion, That this Conſpiracy was at leaſt of Ten years ſtanding, agreed and aſſented to by moſt of the Grandees of <hi>Portugal:</hi> I date not affirm it, nor deny it; for ſuch great actions of State do reſemble Lightning, which once paſt, leave but the greater darkneſs: the Air of State-myſteries is not to be flown in by leſs than Eagles; I ſhall therefore omit to ſearch into ſo great a Privacy, and only recount the Publick Action.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturdoy</hi> the Firſt of <hi>February, Anno, One thouſand ſix hundred and forty,</hi> (and <hi>Saturdayes</hi> have been often obſerved to be propitious to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation,) all the Nobility of the Kingdom, led on by the Marqueſſes of <hi>Ferreira,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Vimioſo,</hi> took Arms, and accompanied with a great multitude of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> and ſome <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Souldiers came to the Caſtle, which ſcituate in the middeſt of <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> ſerves both for a Palace and a Caſtle: this was the reſidence of the Vice-Queen, and hither aſſembled all the Magiſtrates for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of the Kingdom, the Guards which were two Companies of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and two of <hi>High Dutch,</hi> either before gained by ſecret intelligence, or frighted with the great numbers of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> or deſire of Novelty, or elſe perhaps unwilling to make reſiſtance againſt thoſe to whom they were moſt of them joyned by friendſhip or Marriage, without the leaſt oppoſition, abandoning their Poſt, gave them free admittance.</p>
                     <p>Whileſt theſe things had hapned, the Secretary <hi>Vaſconſellos</hi> was in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Office (upon ſome reaſons he had by the Diſcontents of the People, to ſuſpect an Inſurrection) at that inſtant writing into <hi>Spain,</hi> of the Alienation of the minds of the Nobility from the Spaniſh Government, and erneſtly preſſing that ſome rigorous Reſolution might be taken to prevent it; which Letters afterwards taken, did ſufficiently demonſtrate his ill will to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nation.</p>
                     <p>Whil'ſt he was thus buſied, the confuſed noiſe of the Souldiers pierced his ears, at which wondring not ſo much at the tumult, as at what ſhould be the cauſe of it, being accompanied only with a <hi>Dutch</hi>-man, and another of the Guard, he would have gone down, but was hindred by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who came running up, crying, <hi>Kill the Traytor, Kill the Enemy of our Blood;</hi> whereupon not knowing where to ſave himſelf, he fled, with thoſe two accompanying him, into an inner Chamber, and there with his Sword in his hand, accompanied and aſſiſted by thoſe two that were with him, diſpoſed himſelf to ſell his Life at the deareſt rate he could: but his Valour ſtood him in no ſtead, for thoſe two who endeavored to defend him, being ſlain with two Muſquet-ſhot, he ſeeing it vain to defend himſelf there longer, leapt deſperately out of the Window, rather to ſeek his Death, than out of any hopes to ſave his life; for no ſooner was he down, but numberleſs Swords were embrued in his Blood, the very women and children running to tear in pieces his dead body, with the ſame alacrity as he uſed to torment them, when alive.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferreira</hi> was gone to ſecure the Vice-Queen, whom having committed to the Guard of Two hundred Muſquetteers, he calls a Council, and in a ſhort Diſcourſe ſets forth the miſeries the Kingdom had endured whileſt it lay ſubject to the Spaniſh Government, who had ſought no other end but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50649:57"/> their deſtruction: Then putting them in mind of the Valor and Merits of their Nation, he exhorts them to condeſcend to the Election of a New King, nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> as the moſt worthy of the Crown, not ſo much for his Power, Riches, or the Greatneſs of his Houſe, as becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was his indubitable Right; he being the only Perſon left of that Stock, which for ſo many years had gloriouſly governed <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A long Diſcourſe was ſuperfluous to thoſe who were before perſwaded. A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſhout interrupted the Marqueſſes Speech, all of them crying with a loud voice, <hi>That they would have</hi> JOHN <hi>Duke of</hi> Braganza <hi>for their King.</hi> In the whole multitude there was not a face, much leſs a voice that did gainſay this general Vote, either becauſe they did all really rejoyce to ſee that they ſhould again have a King of their own Nation, or becauſe none could without danger oppoſe themſelves to the torrent of ſo a Publick Will.</p>
                     <p>The Duke was at this time at his Countrey-houſe at <hi>Villa-Vitioſa,</hi> whether by accident, or becauſe he would always have had occaſion to excuſe himſelf, if the buſineſs ſhould not have ſucceeded, I cannot gueſs: but by reaſon of his abſence they thought fit to make choice of two Governors, whom, to avoid the pretences of others, they nominated to be the Archbiſhops of <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe began immediately to exerciſe their Command, and were obeyed with ſo much quiet, that in all that great and populous City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> there was none ſlain, but only thoſe before-mentioned; the priſons were opened, nor was there any that ſuffered any wrong, either in their goods or life: All the Shops were opened as if there had not happened any Change of Government.</p>
                     <p>Only the houſe of <hi>Vaſconcellos</hi> was ſackt, with ſo much anger and deſpite, that they did not pardon the very Doors and Windows; nay, ſuch was the fury of the people, that had they not been hindred by the Souldiers of the Guard, they had levelled it with the ground. As for his carcaſe, it ſuffered all thoſe diſgraces which a people wronged both in their liberties and eſtates, could inflict: they ran like mad men to expreſs living ſentiments of Revenge upon his dead and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Corps, vaunting who could invent the neweſt ways of diſgrace and ſcorn, till at length almoſt wearied with their inhumane ſport, they left it in the ſtreet ſo mangled, that it did not ſeem to have the leaſt reſemblance of a man; from whence it was the next day carried by the Fraternity <hi>della miſericordia,</hi> and thrown into the Burying-place of the Moors.</p>
                     <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Alemquer,</hi> after he had by command from the Governor aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſtrongeſt poſts of the City, ſent ſeveral Souldiers into the ſtreets, crying, <hi>Long live King</hi> JOHN <hi>the Fourth;</hi> which the people hearing, diſtracted as it were with very joy, leaving their Trades, ran up and down proclaiming him with voices of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> the greateſt part through exceſs of paſſion, not being able to refrain from tears.</p>
                     <p>The Meſſengers did not run, but flie to the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> to give him notice of his promotion to the Crown: The firſt arrived on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning before day; he feigned a great alteration at this Advice, whereupon ſome have preſumed to ſay, That he had not any knowledge of the Deſign. He ſeemed at firſt not to believe it, but told the Meſſengers, that though he might have deſert, and a ſpirit fit for the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> yet he had neither will nor ambition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. That his enemies wronged him, by tempting him with Stratagems as far from his Genius, as his Faith. But at the arrival of the Count of <hi>Monte Santo,</hi> who came to accompany him to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he ſeemed of another mind; and having been with him in private diſcourſe for the ſpace of about two hours, without any further delay, then what the relating the buſineſs to his Wife, and to the Prince
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50649:58"/> his ſon, made, he departed with the Count from <hi>Villa Vizoſa,</hi> accompanied with about five hundred perſons.</p>
                     <p>Yet others there be that affirm, That he was not only acquainted with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Revolt, but of Council about it, and that ſome time before the Nobility having had a private Meeting at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> it was at firſt propounded, That they ſhould reduce the Kingdom into the form of a Common-wealth; but that not being approved of by the major part, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſtood up, and in a moſt eloquent Speech, having laid before them the miſeries they had endured under the Spaniſh yoke, recommended unto them JOHN Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> as the indubitable Heir of the Crown, and their rightful Soveraign.</p>
                     <p>This Motion needed not to be ſeconded with many Arguments to induce a general Conſent, they all moſt willingly aſſented to it, and concluded to ſend <hi>Gaſton Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigno,</hi> a man of a fluent and voluble tongue, to acquaint the Duke with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and to perſwade him to accept the Crown, and free his Countrey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gaſton</hi> being arrived, with many well-coucht words acquaints him, That there was now a pregnant opportunity offered to recover the indubitable right of his Anceſtors to the Crown of <hi>Portugal:</hi> That the Nobility and Clergy were wholly inclined to redeem themſelves from the Tyranny of the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> by ſecuring the Crown upon his head: That the univerſal <hi>Odium</hi> of the whole People to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Government, the preſent low Condition of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> diſtracted on every ſide with War; the aſſured Aſſiſtance that <hi>France</hi> and other Nations, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating the greatneſs of <hi>Spain,</hi> would lend, were as ſo many Motives to perſwade them not to let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity to regain their liberty: That if he by Refuſal, ſhould be the ſole Enemy to his Countries Freedom, they would effect it themſelves, and reduce it into a Common-wealth; with many other Arguments uſed he, which his Love to the Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> his hatred to the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> or his own Ingenuity prompted to him.</p>
                     <p>The Duke's amazement permitted him not to return a ſudden Anſwer: but after a little pauſe, he replied, That he was highly obliged both to him and all the Nobility, for their affections to him, but that this was a Buſineſs required great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation: That there was no <hi>Medium</hi> between a Throne and a Chair of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that therefore he would firſt adviſe with himſelf, and not raſhly attempt ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous a buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>He therefore communicates the whole buſineſs to his Dutcheſs <hi>Donna Lucia,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> a woman of a Noble, Heroick, and Maſculine Spirit, with her he conſults whether he were beſt accept of the Propoſitions of the Nobility, or to prevent all hazards go to <hi>Madrid:</hi> and being anxious what courſe to take, his Wife nobly told him: <hi>My friend, if thou goeſt to</hi> Madrid, <hi>thou do'ſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the danger of loſing thy life; and if thou accepteſt the Crown, thou do'ſt no more: conſider then whether it be not better to dye Nobly at home, than baſely abroad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words of his Ladies (ſay ſome) animated him to a reſolution to accept the Crown; ſo he returned <hi>Gaſton</hi> in anſwer, That he would conform himſelf to the councels of the Nobility, reſolving to live and run all hazards whatever with them, for the regaining of his Countries Liberty.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferreira</hi> uſed his utmoſt endeavors for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of thoſe Caſtles which ſtill held out for his Catholick Majeſty. The firſt day the Caſtle of <hi>Colline</hi> was rendred, which for its ſituation was judged inexpug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, yet the Captain of it no ſooner ſaw it beſieged, but moved either with Gold, or Fear, he delivered it up on Articles. The Tower of <hi>Belem,</hi> and that <hi>De la Cabera</hi> were ſuddenly ſurprized before they within had any notice of what was done; The ſtrong Fortreſs of St. <hi>Giuliano,</hi> a modern Fortification, and built to defend the Mouth of the River, was ready to ſurrender, when a <hi>Caſtellane,</hi> who was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50649:58"/> there a Priſoner, and under Sentence of Death for the Surrendry of a Fort in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil,</hi> ſhut out the Captain, who was gone to Parlie with the <hi>Portugueſſes,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to defend it many dayes: he might have held it out the Siege, but finding neither Ammunition nor Proviſion, conſumed, as was believed, on purpoſe by the Captain, who unwilling to have the Blot of a Traytor caſt upon him for ſo ſudden a delivery, thought it fitter to be forced by neceſſity to open the Gates to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe.</p>
                     <p>After the Surrendry of Fort <hi>San Giuliano,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferreira</hi> in the name of the King, gave the Sacrament of Fidelity, or an Oath of Allegiance to all the Orders, to wit, to the Clergy, Nobility and Commons, which was received with ſo much readineſs, that had not the Marqueſs ſeen the neceſſary Orders obſerved, the People had run into certain inconveniencies, ſo much they ſtrived to prevent one another in willingneſs to perform this duty.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Sixth of <hi>February,</hi> His Majeſty made his entrance into <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> with all theſe applauſes that a beloved King can expect from his moſt loving Subjects. The rich Liveries given by the Nobles, the Triumphal Arches, the Streets hung with Tapeſtry, the multitudes of the People flocking to ſee him, and the excellent Fire-works, (which were ſo many, that a <hi>Spaniard</hi> cryed out, <hi>Es poſſible que ſe quita un Reyno a el Rey D Felippe, cun ſolas Luminarias &amp; vivas ſinmas excercito in Poder, Gran ſenal y efeto ſin Duda del Brazo de dios todo Podero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo!</hi> Is it poſſible that King <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould be deprived of a Kingdom, with only Lights and Fire-works, without a powerful Army! certainly this is an evident To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that 'tis the Almighty hand of God,) were the leaſt demonſtrations of that Cities love and joy: ſo great was the concourſe of thoſe that flocked to ſee their new King, that though his Majeſty entred into the City by Noon, he could not through the Throng arrive at the Palace till Two hours after Sun-ſet: curioſity and love which uſually have the force to ſtir up all affections, made this People flock ſo faſt to the ſight of their Prince. And becauſe it is prudence in a Publick joy, to accommodate ones ſelf to the will of the moſt, even thoſe who either for envy, or ſome other cauſe, hated the Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> did not ceaſe to make ſome demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of reverence and mirth, and by how much the more they thought themſelves obſerved, by ſo much the more they ſtrove to ſeem other than they were.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty being arrived at the Palace, inſtead of repoſing himſelf, addicted himſelf wholly to conſult about carrying on the War; knowing well that onely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour produces true reſt. The firſt conſultations were concerning the expugnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tower of <hi>St. John,</hi> which of all the Forts in the Kingdom only held out for the Catholick King. To reduce this Cittadel, the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferreira</hi> was ſent in perſon with a numerous Army, though for the moſt part tumultuary, and ill ordered; but what they wanted in diſcipline, they ſupplyed in affection; not refuſing to engage themſelves in the extreameſt dangers: for two days the Marqueſs found ſtrong reſſiſtance, but on the third day it yielded, as it is ſuppoſed, forced rather by bullets of Gold, than of Iron. <hi>Don Antonio de Maſcarendas,</hi> with a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſs</hi> Gariſon was appointed commander of this Fortreſs, which he very diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repaired, not only of the damages now received by Battery, but with other neceſſary fortifications, to bring it to greater perfection.</p>
                     <p>The Kingdom thus ſuddenly reduced to the devotion of King JOHN the fourth, the ſeveral Governors were commanded to their Countries to levy Forces. who liſted the inhabitants indifferently from the age of Eighteen to Sixty; in whom they found ſo much diſpoſition, that many offered their eſtates, and their lives, and would follow the colours, although they had licence to depart.</p>
                     <p>On the 25. of the ſame Month, followed the Coronation of his Majeſty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all thoſe applauſes demonſtrations of joy, which could proceed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50649:59"/> from a people of infinite Riches, who weary of the Command of ſtrangers, were conſequently ambitious of a King of their own Nation.</p>
                     <p>In the publique Place before the Palace upon a moſt ſumptuous Theatre, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a great Stage, and upon that a leſs, upon the top of which but three ſteps higher, ſtood a Chair of State under a Canopy, all covered over with Cloth of Gold. About noon His Majeſty came forth of his Palace Royal in a Suit of Cheſnut coloured Velvet embroidered with Gold, and buttons richly ſet with Diamonds: about his neck was a Collar of great value, whereunto hung the badge of the chief Order of Knight-hood, called <hi>El Ordine di Chriſto.</hi> He was girded with a gilt Sword, his Robe was Cloth of God lined with white, wrought with Gold and flowers, the Sword was born before him by <hi>Don Franciſco De Alello</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Ferreira,</hi> High Conſtable of the Kingdom, and before him was the Kings Banner diſplayed by <hi>Ferdinando Telles de Meneſes</hi> Earl Marſhal, before him went <hi>D. Manrique De Silva,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Govea,</hi> Steward of the Kings Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and ſo in order his Nobles and Grandees of the Realm one before another, before all went <hi>Portugal</hi> King at Arms, with the Heralds Purſuivants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Majeſty being aſcended the Stage, and having placed himſelf in the Chair of Eſtate, had the Crown ſet upon His Head, and the Scepter delivered to him, with the accuſtomed Ceremonies by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> which done, he ſpoke to His Majeſty to this effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Behold, O moſt Sacred Majeſty, theſe your Subjects who do more rejoyce to ſee this day, than of all the days of their lives: They rejoyce to ſee the Crown of</hi> Portugal, <hi>returned into its Antient ſtock, they rejoyce to have found a Father who will govern them like Children, not Tyrannize over them like ſlaves. They here, Great SIR, offer their eſtates, their lives, and oblige themſelves to run through all the accidents of fortunes, to eſtabliſh that Crown upon your Head, which now with ſo much devotion, with ſo much readineſs they have placed upon it. They cannot ſufficiently expreſs their affections to Your Majeſty; could they bring their hearts, and lay them down at your Majeſties feet, they would not refuſe to do it, ſo ſure are they that they have found a King all goodneſs, all love, who will not let ſlip any means for the Eſtabliſhing of the Crown, for the quiet of his Subjects, for augmenting his Dominions, and for the conſervation of thoſe priviledges which have been written with the blood of our progenitors: Be your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty graciouſly pleaſed to accept this common reſentment expreſſed by my mouth, there being nothing that more comforts the minds of good Subjects, than the pleaſing of their Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The good old Prelate ſpoke theſe words with ſo much feeling, that the tears of his eyes teſtified the affection of his heart.</p>
                     <p>To this ſpeech of the Archbiſhops, His Majeſty returned anſwer, in expreſſions equal to his love and greatneſs: That the weight of the Scepter, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crown, were things always diſſonant to his Genius; That he had of late years given them ſufficient teſtimony of it, whilſt they were not more affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate in offering, than he was ready to deny the taking upon him the weight of the Kingdom. That his now condeſcending to their deſires, was only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Kingdom, which had been acquiſted, and agrandized with the blood of his Predeceſſors, and to take it from the hands of thoſe, who beſides their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly poſſeſſing it, had rendred themſelves unworthy of it, by endeavouring by all means to ruine it: in ſum, he concluded with thanks for their love, offering himſelf ready to adventure his health, and life, for their preſervation, the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from ſlavery, and maintaining of their priviledges.</p>
                     <p>This ſhort diſcourſe ended, His Majeſty went to the great Church in the ſame order as before, where being ſet in a Chair of Eſtate, raiſed upon a Stage for that purpoſe, with a Chriſtal Scepter in his right hand, at which ſtood the Lord <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:50649:59"/> and behind him the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> there was placed before him a Table Covered with Cloth of Gold, and a Cuſhion thereon, upon the Cuſhion lay a Gold Crucifix and a Meſſal. Here the Archbiſhops of <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Braga,</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the enſuing Oath to the King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>WE ſwear and promiſe by the grace of God, to rule and govern you well, and juſtly, and to adminiſter juſtice as far as humane frailty will permit, to maintain unto you your Cuſtoms, Priviledges and liberties, granted unto you by the Kings our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. So God help us God, and this his holy Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Oath being adminiſtred, the three Eſtates, to wit, the <hi>Clergy, Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> took the following Oath of Allegiance to his Majeſty, one for every one of the Eſtates, pronouncing theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I <hi>Swear by this holy Goſpel of God, touching corporally with my hand, That I receive for our King and lawful Soveraign, the High and Mighty King</hi> DON JOHN <hi>the fourth, our Soveraign, and do homage unto him, according to the uſe and cuſtome of his Kingdoms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This, and the Ceremonies attendant ended, his Majeſty, accompanied with all his Nobles, returned to his Palace, whether notwithſtanding it was a very great rain, all the <hi>Grandees</hi> went bare-headed, where there was a moſt ſumptuous Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet prepared, but his Majeſty gave himſelf wholly to conſult of preparations for the Warre, ſhewing thereby that Kings in their greateſt felicity and delights, ſhould not forget affairs of State, and taking care for the preſervation of their Subjects.</p>
                     <p>But amongſt debates of the War abroad, there happened one of an affair near home, concerning the placing or diſplacing Officers of State; and becauſe His Majeſty knew that the charge of ſuch Officers, muſt needs be with the reſentment of many, and that there is nothing more alienates the minds of men, than to ſee themſelves undeſervedly deprived of their honours, he took away only the places of two, to wit, that of the <hi>Providitore</hi> of the Cuſtom-houſe, becauſe he was Son-in-Law to <hi>Diego Soarez,</hi> and Brother-in-Law to <hi>Vaſconſellos</hi> the late deſervedly-ſlain Secretary; and that of the Count of <hi>Caſtanhie,</hi> who was Preſident of the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> or Court of Conſcience, becauſe he was too much intereſſed with His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>As for the Infanta <hi>Margarita di Mantoua,</hi> late Vice-Queen, and the Marqueſs <hi>Della Puebla</hi> Kinſman to <hi>Olivarez,</hi> the Caſtle called <hi>Paſos de Angiobregas,</hi> was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them, with Fourteen thouſand Crowns a year for maintenance. An hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Priſon it was, nor could they deſire any thing but liberty, which ſhow'd a great Nobleneſs of mind in King JOHN: but Princes alwayes do like Princes, and much it demonſtrates the Magnanimity of the mind, to honour our Enemies, though they be our Priſoners.</p>
                     <p>Nor muſt we here forget the Magnanimous and Couragious Carriage of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mantoua</hi> late Vice-Queen, during theſe confuſions and diſtractions; for King JOHN ſending to aſcertain her, That ſhe ſhould want none of thoſe Civilities that were ſuitable to a Princeſs of her high Birth, Provided ſhe would forbear all Diſcourſe and Practiſes which might infuſe into any an ill opinion of his preſent Government. She returned Thanks to the Duke, (for ſhe would not ſtile him King) for his Complement: but withal fell into a grave Exhortation to thoſe Nobles that carried the Meſſage, telling them, <hi>That they ſhould lay aſide all vain hopes, and not cozen themſelves, but return to their old Allegiance, according as they were obliged by Oath, which if they did, ſhe doubted not to find them all pardon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reſt of the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> of Authority were confined in the Caſtle, and all the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50649:60"/> Souldiers took the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Pay, either becauſe they believed doing ſo, to be moſt for their intereſt, or elſe becauſe being moſt of them linkt in Parentage with the <hi>Portugueſses,</hi> they believed the <hi>Portugal</hi> intereſt to be their own.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after, <hi>Lucia</hi> now Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Medina Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> with her Son the Prince <hi>Theodoſio</hi> arrived at <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> who were received with all imaginable expreſſions of joy: the Queen was ſoon after Solemnly Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Prince inſtalled, at whoſe Inſtallation, the Nobles and Grandees of the Realm, took to him the following Oath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>WE acknowledge, and receive for our true and natural Prince, the high and excellent Prince</hi> D. Theodoſio, <hi>as Sonne, Heir, and Succeſſor of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord the King; and as his true and natural Subjects, we do him homage in the hands of the King, and after the death of our true and natural King and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of theſe Kingdoms of</hi> Portugal <hi>and</hi> Algarve, <hi>and beyond Sea in</hi> Affrica, <hi>Lord of</hi> Guiana; <hi>of the Conqueſts, Navigation, and commerce in</hi> Ethiopia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia, Perſia, India, <hi>&amp;c. we will obey his Commands and Decrees in all, and through all, both high and low: we will make War and maintain Peace with all thoſe that His Highneſs ſhall Command us: And all this we ſwear to God upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Croſs, and the holy Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Ceremonies performed with all fitting Solemnity, the King, to ſhow that the good of his Subjects was his only care, called an Aſſembly of the Three Eſtates of the Kingdom, who being Convened, and the King ſeated in His Royal Throne, <hi>Don Emanuel D'Acugna</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elvas</hi> made a Speech to them, to the following purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THat one of the firſt Laws of Nature, was, the uniting of men together, from whence Cities and Kingdoms had their Original, and by which they after defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in War, and maintained themſelves in Peace; That for that cauſe His Majeſty had called this Aſſembly to Conſult for the better ſervice of God, Defence in War, and Government in Peace: That there could be no Service of God without Union of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, no Defence without Union amongſt men, no Regular Government without Union of Councils: That His Majeſty did expect to be informed by his loyal Subjects what was for the good of the State; That they were to render thanks to the Almighty, who had given them a King that would govern them by known Laws; That His Majesty did not esteem thoſe Tributes lawful that were paid with tears, and therefore did from that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, take off from His Subjects all Tributes that had been impoſed by the Kings of</hi> Caſtille, <hi>becauſe His Majeſty would not Reign over their Goods, nor over their Heads, nor over their Priviledges, but over their Hearts, hoping that they would find out a ſweet expedient to defend their Countrey against their Potent enemy, who threatned to make them all ſlaves, and to deſtroy, and to annihilate their Nation. That they would therefore, conſidering His Majeſties Goodneſs, and their own Honor, manifeſt at once unto the world, That as never Subjects had ſuch a Gracious King, ſo never King had ſuch Loyal Subjects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Biſhop having ended his Speech, the moſt antient Officer of the Chamber of <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> ſtood up, and in the name of all the three Eſtates, (who ſtood up like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,) returned humble thanks to His Majeſty, for this gracious bounty, heartily profeſſing, That they did not only offer up their Goods, but their Lives to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſervice, earneſtly intreating His Majeſty to diſpoſe both of the one and the other, as he pleaſed. And to manifeſt that their hearts and their mouths concorded in this free offer of themſelves to His Majeſty, they preſently Voted, That Two Millions ſhould be immediately raiſed by the Kingdom: but His Majeſty wiſely and politickly declined the impoſing of a Tax upon his Subject, chuſing rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50649:60"/> of their Benevolence; which made every one ſtrive who ſhould offer moſt; ſo inſtead of the Two Millions, there was in ſhort time brought into the Treaſury Four Millions of Gold.</p>
                     <p>Nor was this Money intended by them, nor employed to any other uſe than to maintain the <hi>Grandezza</hi> and Splendour of the King and Kingdom, there being no need of Money for the payment of Souldiers, every one offering to ſerve freely, and at their own Charge, againſt their Vow'd Enemies the <hi>Caſtillians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let us for ſome time leave the Aſſembly ſitting, and give an account how this Action was reſented into the Spaniſh Court: Moſt mens minds were ſtruck with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, but <hi>Olivarez</hi> came ſmiling to the King, ſaying; <hi>Sir, I pray give me</hi> las Albricias <hi>to hanſel the good news, for now you are more abſolute King of</hi> Portugal <hi>than ever, for the People have forfeited all their Priviledges by this Rebellion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Eſtate of the Duke of</hi> Braganza, <hi>with all his Complices, are yours by right of Confiſcation, ſo that you have enough to diſtribute among your Loyal Subjects by way of reward.</hi> But however <hi>Olivarez</hi> ſeemed thus to diſſemble his paſſion; it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that this news ſtruck deeper into him than any.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> upon the firſt news of the Proclamation of King JOHN, ſent a Letter to him to this purpoſe:

                     <p>Thus was this Kingdom utterly loſt to the Spaniſh Monarchy, and not only it, but with it all that they enjoyed by that Kingdom in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the <hi>Tercera</hi> Iſlands, and other Iſlands in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea the Kingdom of <hi>Algarve, Braſil,</hi> together with all they had in <hi>Affrica,</hi> except the Town of <hi>Cexta,</hi> which was the whole remained to the Spaniſh Nation of all thoſe great Dominions.</p>
                     <p>But that all men might know the greatneſs of their loſs, and what the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> enjoys abroad, take here a brief narration:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Thoſe Iſlands of the <hi>Tercera, Madera,</hi> and St. <hi>Michael,</hi> ſo long time poſſeſſed by the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, which though inconſiderable to their other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, yet deſerve to be mentioned; next thoſe many ſtrong places of which they have made themſelves Maſters in <hi>Affrica,</hi> as in <hi>Guiana,</hi> in the Kingdoms of <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>Angola,</hi> the great Iſland of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> of <hi>Soffola</hi> and <hi>Mozambique:</hi> on the Continent thence paſſing the Month of the Red-Sea, they have ſetled a Trade with <hi>Socatra</hi> and <hi>Calaite;</hi> thence paſſing the Bay of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to the Mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Indus,</hi> they ſubdued <hi>Calecut, Coetium,</hi> &amp;c. the Iſland of <hi>Goa, Ciaul, Daman,</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:50649:61"/> &amp;c. thence toward the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> they poſſeſſed <hi>Ceilam, Malacca, Sumatra, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Larantuca,</hi> &amp;c.

                           </gap>ina</hi> where they fortified <hi>Macoa:</hi> In ſum, the Kingdoms, Provinces, Iſlands, and Cities, that the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation had Conquered, and were poſſeſſed of abroad, may in ſome meaſure be compared to the Antient <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; nor was their Valour much inferior to the <hi>Romans,</hi> if we conſider the War they made with the King of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> who for Puiſſance and Military Courage, or numbers of Men of War, did exceed <hi>Xerxes, Darius,</hi> or <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus;</hi> the Battels they had with <hi>Iſmalucco,</hi> and <hi>Idaliam</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Decam,</hi> both equal to mighty Kings and their Armies, conſiſting of the beſt Warriors of the Eaſt; the War they have waged with the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Malacca, Sumatra,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucco,</hi> as alſo with the Kings of <hi>Bengala, Peug,</hi> and <hi>Siam,</hi> &amp;c. with many other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable powers. Many of thoſe places moſt certain it is, were loſt while the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique King had poſſeſſion of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but with it he likewiſe loſt, and King JOHN IV. had poſſeſſion of above Fifty Towns and Forts accounted impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſuch were, <hi>Mozambique, Cuama, Monomotaſca, Mombaza, Maſiala, Dui, Damam, Bazaine, Chiaul, Onor, Barcelor, Mangalor, Cananor, Cranganor, Cochim Conlan, Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patan, Meliapor,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Ceilam,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Jafanapalan,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> and <hi>Nombrede Jeſu;</hi> then more Northward, <hi>Azarim, Danue Agazim, Maim Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por,</hi> and many other places, in all which were maintained Governours and Souldiers, and a Vice-Roy, reſiding at <hi>Goa,</hi> with Courts of Juſtice, &amp;c. Hither many Kings of the Eaſt uſed to ſend Ambaſſadors to maintain Amity with the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to bring Tribute to him. Thus the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade in the Eaſt extendeth it ſelf no leſs than Four thouſand Leagues, by which Trade all the Gariſons are maintained, and all the Ships (whereof they are oftentimes Two or three Fleets) and much Wealth ſent home every Year; beſides thoſe aforementioned, the Crown of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> has ſeveral Towns on the Coaſt of <hi>Affrica,</hi> ſo ſtrongly fortified, That the Moors of the Countrey could never yet recover them, ſuch as <hi>Tangier,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Thus great a loſs did the Spaniſh Monarchy ſuffer by the Revolt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which the Catholick King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth was very ſolicitous to recover, and to that end and purpoſe did not only conſult with the greateſt States-men at home, but likewiſe with thoſe abroad, from one of whom he to that effect received the enſuing Letter.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                        <body>
                           <p>BY the Letter which your Majeſty was pleaſed to write to me on the 6th. of <hi>March</hi> paſt, I am commanded to deliver my Advice touching the beſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Recovery of <hi>Portugal:</hi> Sir, the Clemency uſed by King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, your Majeſties Grandfather, towards the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was a fatal preſage of the preſent Calamities, and future Deſtruction, not only of <hi>Spain,</hi> but the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, becauſe that Kingdom was only in name, but never really Conquered, remaining Rich, and abundant with the ſame, if not greater Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges than before; the Grandees and Nobles at Home, the People not at all Cruſhed; and (which is more than all) the Government in the hands of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and all his Majeſties other Subjects excluded from all places of Power, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or Profit. Sir, The Holy Scripture, which is the Mirrour and Rule of our Actions, teacheth, That when <hi>Salmanazar</hi> conquered the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he did carry away, not only the Royal Family, but tranſported all the Nobility and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into divers Provinces of his Kingdoms, and into the new Conqueſts ſent new Inhabitants; yet the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were never ſuch inveterate Enemies to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi>
                              <pb n="109" facs="tcp:50649:61"/> as the <hi>Portugals</hi> with deviliſh madneſs have ſhewed themſelves againſt the Intereſt and Conveniencies of this Monarchy.</p>
                           <p>Moreover in the ſame Scripture it is read, That <hi>Nebuchadonoſor</hi> having Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> tranſplanted all that he found in that Kingdom, leaving only a few miſerable inconſiderable people to remain there.</p>
                           <p>So <hi>Athalia</hi> Queen of <hi>Judah</hi> ſaw no other way to preſerve a Kingdom newly Conquered, but by extinguiſhing all the Generation, upon whom the <hi>Jews</hi> could caſt their eyes in hopes of Revolt.</p>
                           <p>And <hi>Jehu,</hi> King elected by God, extinguiſhed all the Family of <hi>Ahab,</hi> together with all his dependants, friends, and acquaintance, not ſparing ſo much as the Prieſts.</p>
                           <p>Theſe, Sir, are the Rules that the Holy Scripture teacheth to be practiſed upon the Families and People that abhor the Dominion of their own Soveraigns.</p>
                           <p>It was, Sir, very fatal to ſtand expecting and hoping for better times and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for the ſecuring of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the Yeer, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and thirty nine,</hi> obſerving the ill affection of that Nation, my Advice was, That without any delay that Kingdom was to be ſecured by Force of Arms; others were of the ſame Judgments, but Fate would have it that (for fear of new troubles) by delayes way ſhould be made for Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than which there could not have been a greater, although that Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which was expedient for the Spaniſh Monarchy, and was alwayes held neceſſary for the preſerving that Crown, had been put in execution with the greateſt violence imaginable.</p>
                           <p>But when a Jewel is gone, the main enquiry ſhould be, By what means it may be found again, not How it came to be loſt.</p>
                           <p>The firſt means of recovering that Crown, may be (what your Majeſties Grand-father made uſe of) to buy your Rights of your own Subjects by Gifts and Promiſes, wherein your Majeſty is to be as Prodigal, as the <hi>Portugals</hi> are inſolent in expecting or demanding, and indeed experience teacheth, That that Nation is ſo addicted to their own Intereſt, that more may be effected this way, than by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Army: to him will they be ſubject who will give moſt, or from whom moſt can be expected herein, Prodigality will be good Husbandry; for when <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhall be returned to the obedience of your Majeſty, all that Wealth which hath been beſtowed amongſt them, will return likewiſe.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond means is by courſe of Arms, but this will be difficult at preſent, by Reaſon of the ſeveral Engagements of this Monarchy elſewhere: I ſuppoſe Sir, That in caſe <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould be Conquered by Force, all their Conqueſts in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> &amp;c. will remain in their hands; for thither will they all flie, and from thence will they be alwayes ready to aſſiſt our Enemies; wherefore it would be very expedient for your Majeſties ſervice, that a Truce were firſt made with the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> upon condition that they make War upon the <hi>Portugal</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and have whatever they can Conquer, whence will ariſe this Commodity that they will want the Wealth of their Conqueſts, your Majeſty being diſengaged with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> will ſooner Conquer them at home, and the <hi>Hollander</hi> will only come to receive to day at the hand of your Majeſty, what to morrow the <hi>Portugal</hi> muſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up to them: At the ſame time the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Flemings</hi> may ſcour the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Engliſh may be invited to a more frequent Navigation in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> whereby the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade may eaſily be ruined.</p>
                           <p>The third way is, that the Pope be perſwaded to thunder his Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> and againſt the whole Kingdom, as Perjured and Perturbators of the publick Peace, animating all Chriſtian Princes to aſſiſt in the regaining that Kingdom, upon pretence of advancing the Catholick Faith.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, diffidencies and jealouſies between the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> and other
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50649:62"/> people, may eaſily be fomented by means of Merchants, Strangers, and by <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Burgundians,</hi> under the name of <hi>French.</hi> And to effect theſe diffidencies the better, a Treaty may really be begun with the Duke, which being diſcovered by the People (though it be before the Duke could know thereof) they will deſtroy him and all his Family, and in ſuch caſe the Civil diſſentions will open a way for your Majeſty to recover your Rights: deſperate evils muſt have deſperate reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> is the Cancer of the Spaniſh Monarchy; therefore,
<q>Enſe recidendum: ne pars ſymera trahatur.</q> Let not your Majeſty defer the right Remedy, the greateſt Rigor is here the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Charity; and to have no Charity, is to have much Prudence; to Bury this <hi>Hydra</hi> in its own aſhes, will be Triumph enough; to live without this arm, will be better than to have it employed againſt ones own head: Let your Majeſty never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or hope better of that Nation, than you have ſeen theſe Sixty years paſt; never think to keep that Countrey, if not planted with other People; the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt your Majeſties Government, is hereditary.</p>
                           <p>The Intereſt of the King, Sir, is very ample, and hath no bounds againſt Rebels, every action is juſt and honourable that tends to the recovery of the Kings right.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, a Truces is to be made with the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> whereby they being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the tumultuous courſes of War, will have time to take notice of the French inſolencies, and growing weary of that Yoke, will at length eaſily embrace the next opportunity to return to their obedience, which once effected, will make the People of <hi>Portugal</hi> waver betwixt hopes and fears, and beget variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt them, which for the Conquering of Kingdoms (the Emperour <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> uſed to ſay) was much more advantageous than the force of an Army, as the Grand-father of your Majeſty found in the Succeſſion of <hi>Portugal:</hi> To this may be added, That it will be very expedient that your Majeſty name Biſhops to diſpoſe of all Governments, and Offices of the Crown, to the moſt confiding Perſons in that Kingdom, for this will beget diſtruſt amongſt them all, and the ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not knowing whom to truſt, will put all into Confuſion, whereby your Majeſties ſervice will be more eaſily advanced.</p>
                           <p>This in obedience to your Majeſties Commands, I have imparted my weak ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wherein if I have erred, your Majeſties goodneſs will attribute it to my want of abilities, not of affection: God preſerve the Catholick and Royal Perſon of your Majeſty, as the Chriſtian World, and we your Majeſties Subjects have need.</p>
                        </body>
                     </floatingText>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe endeavors, and theſe propoſed Artifices, nothing prevailed towards the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s recovery of this Kingdom, nor was it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any of theſe Deceits ever ſhould, whil'ſt is conſidered the extraordinary love and affection which the whole Nation of the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> bore to the Family of their preſent King, and the inveterate hatred which they did, and always have born to the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> which was ſo exceeding great, that it is believed they would rather have ſuffered themſelves to be extirpated and routed out, than again ſubmit their Necks to the Spaniſh Yoke.</p>
                     <p>And that ever the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould again recover it <hi>per</hi> force, is incredible, if we either conſider the Union and Unanimity of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, and their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to undergo the greateſt miſeries of War can inflict, or the Intereſt of all the other Princes of Chriſtendom, who may juſtly ſuſpect the encroaching greatneſs of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and therefore endeavor rather to Lop off more Limbs from that great Body, than ſuffer this to be rejoyned.</p>
                     <p>But it is now high time to return to a Review of the Actions of the Grand Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Eſtates of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who next Reſolved to Diſpatch Ambaſſadors to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50649:62"/> all States of Chriſtendom, to enter into Confederacies, for the better defence and eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom, and for the Glory and Reputation of the King.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, the Father <hi>Ignatius Maſcarenas</hi> a Jeſuite, with another Father of the ſame Order, was ſent into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> to offer them all aſſiſtance and ſupplies for their maintenance, and defence againſt the Catholique King, for very well did the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> know that it highly did import his Intereſt to correſpond with them, that ſo they might joyntly, not onely defend, but alſo offend the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Country lying betwixt them both, they might at pleaſure invade, or moleſt it, either by Sea or Land.</p>
                     <p>This Embaſſie of King JOHN'S ſo rejoyced and encouraged the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> that the very next day after the Ambaſſadors had Audience, they obtained a moſt ſignal Victory in their own defence againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had aſſaulted them with an Army of twenty five thouſand men under the Command of the Marquiſs <hi>De los veles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Shortly after that the Father <hi>Ignatius Maſcarenas</hi> was diſpatched to the <hi>Cataloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans D. Franciſco de Mello,</hi> and <hi>Don Antonia Caelle Carravallio,</hi> (perſons both of excellent and admired abilities, the one for his great experience and judgment in State-affairs, and the other for his noble Spirit, and eminent knowledge in the Civil Law) to go on a ſolemn Embaſſie to the moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Lewis</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe attended with a Stately and moſt Magnificent Train, landed ſoon after at <hi>Rochel</hi> and on the fifteenth of <hi>March</hi> 1641. made a ſolemn Entrance into <hi>Paris,</hi> being met and conducted in by a great number of Coaches, filled with the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the Kingdom, beſides numbers of the French Nobility, who came to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them on horſe-back.</p>
                     <p>Thus accompanied, they were conducted to the Palace appointed for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Extraordinary Ambaſſadors, where they were in a ſumptuous and magnificent manner feaſted at the Kings Charges.</p>
                     <p>From thence they were by the Duke of <hi>Chevereux,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Brulon,</hi> conducted in the Kings Coaches unto his Majeſty then at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> to receive the firſt Audience; which was performed with extraordinary ſhews of love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: for upon the entrance of the Ambaſſadors into the place appointed for their Audience, the King roſe out of his Chair of Eſtate: and went forward three ſteps to receive them, nor would he permit them to deliver their Embaſſie with their Hats off, or to deſcend ſo low, as to kiſs his hands at their departure, but in ſtead of that Ceremony, he affectionately imbraced them in his Arms, promiſing them the greateſt Aſſiſtance his Power was able to give.</p>
                     <p>They were from the Kings preſence conduced to a ſumptuous Dinner provided for them, and after that brought to the Queens Lodging, who was ſet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their coming: at their entrance ſhe likewiſe roſe, and advanced three ſteps to meet them, receiving them with a cheerful and courteous countenance, and not permitting them to be uncovered.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt other Diſcourſes which they had with her, <hi>D. Franciſco de Mello</hi> told her, That he feared his Embaſſie might not be acceptable, becauſe the King his Maſter had deprived her Brother of one of his Kingdoms. Whereunto ſhe readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>That though ſhe was ſiſter to the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>yet ſhe was wife to the King of</hi> France.</p>
                     <p>After ſome Diſcourſe in <hi>French,</hi> her Majeſty began to ſpeak to them in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> which they obſerving, deſired to know wherefore her Majeſty had not vouchſafed them that favor ſooner, it being a Language by them better underſtood; To which the Queen jeſtingly anſwered, For fear they ſhould be frighted, to hear her ſpeak <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and the Embaſſador to improve the jeſt, replyed, <hi>Como a tum Grand
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50649:63"/> Signora ſi, pero coma a Caſtiliano no,</hi> that it was true conſidering her Greatneſs, but not her Country: The Queen ſmiling, went on, promiſing them all aſſiſtance poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and wiſhing all proſperity to King JOHN and his Queen; and ſo they having delivered her Majeſty a Letter from the Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> took their leave.</p>
                     <p>From her Majeſty they went to viſit his Eminence the Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who being advertiſed of their coming, came forward to the third Chamber to meet them, where he received them with expreſſions of great affection, and promiſes and proffers of ſervices, and from thence conducted them to his own Chamber.</p>
                     <p>Being all three ſate, the Cardinal (who was the moſt experienced and greateſt Stateſman of his time) diſcourſed with them of divers affairs of great importance, and they endeavored to explain to his Eminence what was before his ſentiment, that it very much imported the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> to be united by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble League, conſidering that it was the Chief and Principal end and aim of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> (whoſe Branches were ſpread over almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi>) not only to be the greateſt, but to be the ſole and only Monarch of <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> That to effect thoſe ambitious deſires, he had never made ſcruple to uſurp and ſeize upon Kingdoms and States upon the leaſt pretences imaginable, as had appeared in the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples, Sicily, Navarre,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Millan,</hi> and lately ſeveral States in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſeizing upon the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> whereby they had a paſſage open to lead an Army of <hi>Germans</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>That conſidering the vaſt power and intereſt that this Family had, not only in <hi>Europe,</hi> but alſo in <hi>America,</hi> it could not but be confeſſed, That they had a large foundation of their imaginary Univerſal Monarchy; but that nothing gave them ſo great hopes, as the poſſeſſion of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For by the addition of that Kingdom to the Crown of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> they became ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſters, not only of all <hi>Spain,</hi> but of all the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> of all the Eaſtern Trade of <hi>Ethiopia, Perſia, Arabia, China, Japan,</hi> and all that incredible wealth that was raiſed out of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Traffick, whereby the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Greatneſs (if not their Monarchy) was principally ſuſtained, that therefore it concerned all States whatſoever, not only to put a ſtop to the raving Tyranny of this devouring Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but to ſuppreſs and leſſen his Power by all means poſſible.</p>
                     <p>That to do this, none was more concerned, or more able, than the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> united with that of <hi>Portugal:</hi> That this having been called the Right Arm (as <hi>Catalonia</hi> the Left) of that great <hi>Austrian Coloſſus,</hi> now both being ſeparated from it, and united to <hi>France,</hi> will be able to do greater ſervice againſt it, than they were ever forced to do for it, not only by aſſaulting the <hi>Spaniard</hi> within his own doors, but by intercepting the <hi>Plate-Fleet;</hi> which in its return from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> it being neceſſarily forced to paſs by the <hi>Tercera</hi> Iſlands, muſt run in danger of the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Fleet, or be forced to be at the Charge of an extraordinary Convoy.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the ſum of the Ambaſſadors Diſcourſes to the Cardinal: In anſwer to which, his Eminence made offer, not only of all the Aſſiſtance of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King his Maſter, but that he would disburſe himſelf for the ſervice of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> promiſing that he would preſently ſend thither a Fleet of Twenty Sail with his Nephew, Admiral and Ambaſſador Extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>This Treatment thus ended, the Ambaſſadors took their leaves, his Eminence waiting upon them as far as the Stairs; which when they endeavored to hinder, he replied, That the Ambaſſadors of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> were to be Treated with as much Reſpect as thoſe of the <hi>Emperor</hi> or <hi>Pope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Few dayes after, a <hi>Juncto</hi> of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Council, were appointed to Treat with the Ambaſſadors in the Houſe of the Lord High Chancellor of the Kingdom, where a Peace was fully concluded between the two Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:50649:63"/>
                     <p>Other Ambaſſadors were (about the ſame time that the afore-mentioned were ſent into <hi>France</hi>) diſpatched into <hi>England;</hi> for it very much concerned the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Portugal</hi> to maintain a good Correſpondence with the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> both in regard of the Navigation and Commerce of both States, and alſo the better to break that Amity and good Underſtanding which was now held between the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and that State. Hither therefore were ſent Don <hi>Antonio D'Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and Don <hi>Franciſco D'Averado Leilon,</hi> both perſons of exquiſite parts; who, notwithſtanding that the Dunkirkers Chaſed them, arrived ſafe in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for all the ſturdy endeavors of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors, they were received on ſhore with abundance of Reſpect; yet His Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> would not give them Audience, or accept of the Ambaſſage from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſo tender was He of His Honor and Conſcience, till Don <hi>Antonia de Soſa</hi> their Secretary, had drawn up a Paper, to ſatisfie Him of the Right and Title of the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The ſum of which was:
<q>
                           <p>Upon the Death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinal, without Iſſue, many pretended (together with the <hi>Infanta Donna Catherina</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> and Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to this preſent King) to the Crown of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but all their pretences want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundation, ſoon fell, except that of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who propt up his with force.</p>
                           <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> was Uncle, equally near to both, but with this difference; <hi>Catherine</hi> was the Daughter of a Son named <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> was the Son of a Daughter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Brother and Siſter to King <hi>Henry.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> pleaded, That he being in equal degree with <hi>Catherine,</hi> was to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his Sex.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Catherine</hi> replyed, That the Conſtitution of that Kingdom allowing Females to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and withal the benefit of Repreſentation in all Inheritances, ſhe repreſenting <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> muſt exclude <hi>Philip</hi> by the very ſame right that her Father (if he were living) would exclude <hi>Philips</hi> Mother.</p>
                           <p>This Concluſion is infallible in <hi>Jure:</hi> whereto <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered, That Succeſsion of Kingdoms deſcending <hi>Jure ſanguinis,</hi> there was allowed no Repreſentation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Catherine</hi> destroyed that foundation, alledging, That the Succeſsion by the Death of the laſt King, was derived <hi>Jure haereditatis, &amp; non ſanguinis,</hi> becauſe the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Kingdoms was to be regulated by that Antient way, whereby all things deſcended by Inheritance; the other way of Succeſſion being not known until later Ages, nor ever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed either in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal</hi> in ſuch Caſes.</p>
                           <p>Briefly in behalf of <hi>Catherine</hi> it was urged, (which by the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> can never be denied, or anſwered) That ſhe was no ſtranger, but a Native of the Kingdom, to whom alone (according to the Laws of <hi>Lamego</hi>) the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> can appertain.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King having peruſed and deliberated upon this Paper, gave immediately Order they ſhould be preſently conducted to <hi>London,</hi> which was done with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Solemnity, and they lodged in a Palace ready prepared for them: ſoon after with great Ceremony they received Audience of His Majeſty, in a fair and Stately Hall prepared for that purpoſe, where His Majeſty ſate upon a Throne raiſed two ſteps, and at the entrance of the Ambaſſador pulled off His Hat, nor would be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered till they were ſo too.</p>
                     <p>To the Propoſitions made in the Speech of D. <hi>Antonia D'Almoda,</hi> concerning a Peace between <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> His Majeſty replied, That he ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad if an expedient might be found out to renew the Antient Leagues of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between the two Crowns, without the breaking with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some few dayes after, the Ambaſſadors were conducted to give a Viſit to <hi>Mary</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:50649:64"/> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who ſate in a Chair of Eſtate ready to entertain them: when they came into the Preſence, She roſe out of the Chair, and came as far as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petting, making low reverence as the Ambaſſadors bowed; when they came near, Her Majeſty made them be covered, but afterwards they ſpoke with their Hats off. In concluſion the Queen told them, That ſhe much deſired to hold Correſpondence with Her Majeſty of <hi>Portugal.</hi>

From thence they paſſed into <hi>Sweden,</hi> and were Magnificently entertained at the young Queens Court at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> where a League was ſoon concluded, and the Ambaſſadors diſmiſſed, according to the Cuſtom of that Nation, with Gold Chains, and the Queens Portraicture in a Meddal of Gold.</p>
                     <p>The Ambaſſador D. <hi>Triſtano De Mendoza Hurtada,</hi> that was ſent to the States of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> was received with the like Magnificence and ſeeming affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and a Truce concluded with the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> for Ten years; for a Peace the States would not aſſent to, becauſe they having Conquered many places in <hi>Braſil, Angola,</hi> &amp;c which belonged to the Crown and Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> could not make reſtitution of them, by reaſon they now belonged to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; nor could the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> allow the Conqueſt, as things of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Crown, and depending on it.</p>
                     <p>But now we come to treat of a more ſolemn Embaſſie, to wit, that to the Pope: Long was it debated in the Aſſembly of Eſtates, whether an Ambaſſador ſhould be ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> immediately, or a more opportune conjuncture of time be expected. Some were of opinion that the ſending an Ambaſſador without further delay, would be a teſtification of their duty, and incline the Popes Holineſs to acknowledge DON JOHN the lawful Heir, and rightful King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which would extreamly further and advance the Affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But others there were who conceived thoſe things rather deſirable than feaſable, and were of the opinion they ſhould rather ſtay till a fitter opportunity, alledging, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s preſent power at <hi>Rome,</hi> might probably oppoſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of their Ambaſſador: that although the Pope never was in his heart a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> yet he would never yield to ſhow himſelf an enemy to the Catholick King: That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cunningly fomenting the opinion which all the world had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainted, that his Holineſs did in all things favor the <hi>French</hi> intereſt, would from ſuch a Reception, draw as much as ever they could ask or deſire. That for this cauſe the Pope (that he might not ſeem their enemy) had alwayes granted them whatever they deſired; That therefore they thought it convenient firſt to ſound his Holineſs, before they run the hazard of the diſgrace and affront which might fall upon his Majeſty, and the whole Kingdom; That in caſe the Pope ſhould decline the reception of the Ambaſſador, to whom could they repair or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to vindicate the injury done to the Crown? That many Popes had been ſo faſcinated to the intereſt of their own family, that the world had very great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to believe, that their deſigns tended rather to what was beſt for themſelves, than to what was beſt indeed: That the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, had as much reaſon to diſtruſt the See of <hi>Rome</hi> as any, whilſt they had to their coſt had examples how they onely purſued their own ends. As particularly <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, who at
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50649:64"/> firſt ſeemed ſo affectionate to the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that he imployed the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his Power for the Intereſt of his own Family, approved of all that King had done; that there was none who had more to give, or at leaſt who had more to promiſe, than the Catholick King; ſo that in any buſineſs of Competition he muſt neceſſarily gain the better.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe Arguments to the contrary, upon the promiſes of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to be a Mediator at the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Reception of their Ambaſſadors, by the ſuffrage of ſome few Voices, to make the <hi>major</hi> part, it was concluded, That Ambaſſadors ſhould immediately be ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in purſuance of this Vote, the King immediately made choice of two Reverend and able Perſons, to wit, <hi>Michael De Portogallo,</hi> Son to the Count <hi>Vimio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> of the Blood <hi>Royal,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lamego,</hi> and <hi>D. Petableone Rodriguiz,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elvas:</hi> No ſooner was the news arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> of their being landed in <hi>Italy,</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> muſtred themſelves together, with reſolution either to oppoſe their entrance, or at leaſt hinder their reception; whil'ſt on the other ſide the <hi>French, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Catalonians</hi> aſſembled themſelves together, reſolving to hazard their deareſt Blood in their Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>His Holineſs ſeeing theſe preparations on both ſides, feared leſt his Countrey ſhould be made the Seat of a petty War, and conſidering that in any caſe the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would accrue to him, if whil'ſt under his Command and Protection, the Perſon of an Ambaſſador ſhould be violated, ſtrictly Commanded all his Guards to take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care to prevent the Violencies intended.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> by this Order hindred from what they purpoſed, their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors openly proteſted, That if his Holineſs did receive the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſador, they would immediately leave <hi>Rome.</hi> But notwithſtanding theſe proteſtations, and all other oppoſition they could poſſibly make, in <hi>November, One thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty one,</hi> the two <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſadors being met by divers Cardinals, Princes, and Cavaliers, well armed, entred into <hi>Rome,</hi> and were conducted to the Palace of the French Ambaſſador, who received them with all Reſpect poſſible, ſtill giving them the precedence.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon ſeveral Manifeſto's are ſcattered abroad by the two Spaniſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, the Marqueſs <hi>De los Veles,</hi> and D. <hi>John Chiumarrero,</hi> labouring to prove that his Holineſs ought not to receive the Ambaſſadors of the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> as they ſtiled him. Firſt, becauſe he was a Tyrant, and Uſurper of that Kingdom, which had been in the quiet poſſeſſion of the Catholick King theſe Sixty years. Secondly, Becauſe he was a Rebel, and a Perjured Perſon, having ſworn Allegiance to the Catholick King. Thirdly, That the Reception of theſe Ambaſſadors would ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate other Subjects of the Catholick King to Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>But whil'ſt the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors are violently ſhooting ſuch Paper-Bullets, the <hi>Portugueſses</hi> uſed all their endeavors, both by themſelves, and the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, (who had expreſs Order from the moſt Chriſtian King his Maſter to that purpoſe,) to prevail with the Pope, to give them Audience, and admit their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie: but his Holineſs was ſo fearful to diſpleaſe the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> leſt he ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards take occaſion to revenge himſelf upon his Nephews, that he utterly declined their Reception, yet not out of any of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Allegations, but upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that certain of the Church Rites had been violated in <hi>Portugal;</hi> the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> and other Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, being kept in durance, though it was for very good reaſons, as hereafter ſhall appear.</p>
                     <p>Yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not content with this Reſolution of his Holineſs, but (whil'ſt the <hi>Portugals</hi> were endeavoring to prove their Cauſe, by both Political and Legal Declarations, Allegations, and Arguments,) fearing leſt the Pope might chance to alter his mind, reſolved to make a quick diſpatch of the Buſineſs, and to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50649:65"/> that purpoſe Two hundred <hi>Banditi</hi> were hired to ſeize upon the Biſhop of <hi>Lamego,</hi> and carry him to <hi>Naples,</hi> as the Prince of <hi>Sans</hi> had been before ſerved by them, and there put to Death.</p>
                     <p>But this Deſign, themſelves at length could not agree upon, for the Marqueſs <hi>De Los Velos,</hi> thought it would be better and leſs dangerous to give the <hi>Portugals</hi> a Publick Affront in the City, which was concluded to be put in effect, and to that purpoſe it was communicated to the reſt of the Nation, (whereof upon ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions there are alwayes many in <hi>Rome</hi>) who aſſembled together well Armed at the Ambaſſadors Palace: and ſo great is the Power of Revenge: that to the end they might the better effect their deſign, and yet not appear as Souldiers, though there were many Gentlemen of quality amongſt them, they condeſcended to go under the name of Foot-men to the Marqueſs.</p>
                     <p>The Popes Holineſs hearing of the great preparations of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſent to them to let them know, that he could not but be very much diſtaſted to ſee ſuch diſorders attempted in a peaceable City, and therefore deſiring them for his Honors ſake to deſiſt, and withal ſent a Meſſenger to the Biſhop of <hi>Lamego,</hi> to aſſure him that he need not fear any thing, for upon the Word of his Holineſs, he ſhould walk the Streets undiſturbed.</p>
                     <p>But do the Pope what he could, either by threats, deſires, or perſwaſions, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were reſolved to proſecute their deſign, which they put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their own coſt, on the twenty of <hi>Auguſt, One thouſand ſix hundred forty two.</hi> On which day the Biſhop of <hi>Lamego</hi> going to viſit the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, one of his retinue obſerved, that he was dog'd by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Spie; whereupon a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Spie was ſent to the Marqueſſes to bring intelligence what they were doing there, who brought word to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, that there was great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Coaches and Men: whereupon the <hi>French, Portugals,</hi> and <hi>Catalonians,</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and armed themſelves with Piſtols and Fire-locks, to convoy home the Biſhop.</p>
                     <p>By the way they were met by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, accompanied with about eight Coaches full of Captains and Officers come from <hi>Naples,</hi> and guarded with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixty Foot-men, beſides divers others of that Nation. No ſooner came they in ſight of the Biſhops Coach, but they cried aloud, <hi>Che ſi fermaſſero all' Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatore di Spagna;</hi> that they ſhould ſtop for the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain:</hi> but the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> driving on, anſwered, <hi>Che fi fermaſſero Lavo,</hi> that they ſhould ſtop.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon both ſides with their Swords drawn leapt out of the Coaches, and making a ſtand, one Gun was firſt fired by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſide, and immediately ſeconded with a brave volley on both ſides; when they fell into Swords point, the Biſhops ſide ſoon getting the better of it, yet there was ſlain a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> page, but on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Marqueſſes ſide, there were eight killed upon the place, and above twenty wounded, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs leaving his Coach-horſes dead, eſcaped out of the back of the Coach, which ſtood upon the place till next day, and got into the next ſhop without his hat, and trembling for fear, from whence he was carried to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornoz</hi> Palace. The <hi>Portugueſſe</hi> Ambaſſador returned firſt to the <hi>French</hi> Palace, and from thence went ſafely home.</p>
                     <p>His Holineſs the Pope was extreamly perplexed at theſe diſturbances, and therefore to prevent the like for the future, Commanded a guard of Souldiers to be put upon the houſes, both of the Biſhop and the Marqueſs. But ſhortly after, when the Biſhop of <hi>Lamego</hi> had again preſſed the Pope, by a large memorial of the reaſons why he ſhould be received, and was abſolutely refuſed, he was by his Maſter the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> called home.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe things were acting abroad, the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> begun to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual in-roads into the borders of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which made King JOHN look more narrowly into the defence of his Kingdom, fortifie all the Frontiers, and train up his Subjects to military exerciſes.</p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:50649:65"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in one in-road which they made into <hi>Portugal,</hi> laid waſte all before them, ſparing neither Sex nor Age whereſoever they came, which made the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals</hi> in revenge, commit the like out-rages in an in-road they made into <hi>Gallicia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But theſe were publick enmities, and therefore more eaſie to be oppoſed; but there was a private Serpent that lay Lurking at home, which was ſo much the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to do miſchief, by how much it was more ſecretly hidden. Some few there were who thought themſelves ſo highly obliged to the Catholick King, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the re-uniting of the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> to his vaſt Dominions, and again inſlave their Countrey to Forreigners.</p>
                     <p>The principal of theſe was the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> alwayes a great Creature and Favourite of the Count <hi>Olivarez,</hi> who had at the beginning of the Revolt, ſhow'd himſelf ſo oppoſite to the Freedom of his Countrey, that many Gentlemen were once reſolved to make him ſuffer the ſame fate with <hi>Vaſconcellos</hi> the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Nor had he ceaſed ever ſince to ſhow viſible ſigns of his diſcontentment at the Government.</p>
                     <p>In this Arch-biſhops head was the whole Conſpiracy firſt hatch't, and by him communicated to <hi>D. Lewis de Meneſes</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Villa-real,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migna</hi> his Son, two Perſons ſufficiently Ambitious, and both diſcontented, as not thinking themſelves ſufficiently rewarded according to their Merit: Theſe the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop tampered with, perſwading them, That it was a low and unworthy thing, much beneath their Birth and Greatneſs, to ſuffer themſelves to be ſubject to a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subject: That it would be much more Noble and Generous in them, to return their Allegiance to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> their Antient Soveraign, who was able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow more upon a Perſon deſerving in one day, than the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> could in an hundred years. Theſe and few other Arguments were ſufficient to draw thoſe, who before out of their envy to the Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> were inclinable to a change.</p>
                     <p>Theſe made ſure, the Arch-biſhop next draws into this Plot a Gentleman of a Noble Blood, named, <hi>D. Augustine Emanuel,</hi> a man of excellent parts, but ſomewhat neceſſitated, nor had ever been looked upon, or put into any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which without any other incentives, were motives ſufficient to move a man to any deſperate deſign. Next him was added to this Conſpiracy, <hi>Pietro Baeza,</hi> a lately converted <hi>Jew,</hi> whom the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> call Upſtart Chriſtians; he was Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for nothing, but his vaſt Riches; being a great <hi>Criado</hi> of the Count <hi>Olivarez,</hi> whoſe Favour, he uſed often to ſay, would one day advance him to high Honor, or to a high pair of Gallows, which laſt proved very true.</p>
                     <p>Many private Meetings had theſe, and ſome few other Conſpirators, where they debated to bring their Deſigns to effect; ſome were of opinion, that before they could bring it to perfection, more ſhould be acquainted with it, for it was impoſſible that ſo few ſhould ever be able to compaſs it: But in this courſe there aroſe many fears and doubts, leſt too many being acquainted with it, ſome ſhould diſcover it, as had often hapned in Deſigns of that high Nature: yet at length it was found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to draw more into the Plot, for whil'ſt they were ſo few, the Buſineſs only reſted in imagination, but could never be put in execution.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore added ſome more to the number, their next debates were of the manner how to bring it to effect; ſome adviſed that a Power of the Catholick Kings was to be got in a readineſs, but they then thought that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> would raiſe as great a force, and ſo prevent a ſudden Invaſion: Yet in anſwer to that Objection, it was by ſome alledged, That the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by way of Intelligence might be let in, which again ſeemed as difficult, the <hi>Militia</hi> being in the hands of Perſons moſt Loyal and Truſty to the King: Others propoſed, That the only way to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, was by a ſudden and violent making away of the King; but this advice was oppoſed by moſt, who inclined to a mediocrity, and would rather have found out a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50649:66"/> way to make his Majeſty renounce his own Right and Title to the Crown, and retire himſelf from the dangers which ſhould be preſented unto him.</p>
                     <p>But whil'ſt they thus wavered in opinions, and inclined to that moderation, which is the ruine of all Deſigns of this Nature, they gave the King time and occaſion to ſearch out their Plots; for his Majeſty having alwayes had a ſuſpitious eye upon the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Villa-Real,</hi> and having received now private notice, that they had had ſundry Meetings, and were obſerved daily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Perſons as diſcontented as themſelves, endeavored by all means poſſible to know the depth of their Counſel, and at length intercepts ſome of their Letters to <hi>Madrid,</hi> which diſcovered not only the whole Plot, but even the names of all the Conſpirators.</p>
                     <p>The Act of Holding Correſpondence with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> was Treaſon in it ſelf, ſufficient to take away their lives, being contrary to his Majeſties expreſs command, its being to this intent, made it but ſo much the more hainous: His Majeſty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not knowing how far it might have proceeded, made no delayes, but preſently by the ſound of Drum and Trumpet (as the Cuſtom is) cauſed to be Proclaimed, That he intended to go forth of the City; upon which all the Nobles and Gentry, according to the uſual manner, aſſembled at the Palace to accompany his Majeſty, who when he ſaw them all ready, commanded firſt that a Council of Eſtate ſhould be called, which was done, many of the Conſpirators being aſſiſtant in it, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſate, his Majeſty without any noiſe cauſed them to be arreſted one by one, which without the taking of this courſe, he could never have effected; for if the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy had been detected, before their Perſons had been ſeized, they had either been torn in pieces by the fury of the People, or elſe had ſome of them eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>It was very ſtrange that of all the Plotters in this Conſpiracy, not one ſhould, either by accident, or otherwiſe, eſcape, for the Perſons of theſe now taken, were no ſooner impriſoned, but his Majeſty publiſhed a Proclamation, declaring a Free Pardon to all the Complices in this Conſpiracy, that ſhould within Four dayes come and acknowledge their fault, and beg it; but the Kings diligence had been ſuch before, that there was not one left to accept of this Grace.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after thoſe who had been taken, were Arraigned according to Law, found Guilty of High Treaſon, and in manner following executed.</p>
                     <p>On the laſt day of <hi>Auguſt, One thouſand ſix hundred and forty one,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Villa-Real,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Camigna,</hi> his Son, the <hi>Count de Armamac,</hi> and <hi>D. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine Manuele,</hi> were led along a Gallery to a Scaffold erected for the purpoſe, with two ſtories, on the uppermoſt of which ſtood two Chairs, on the next one, and on the Scaffold it ſelf the fourth.</p>
                     <p>The firſt that was conducted forth to Execution, was the Marqueſs of <hi>Villa-Real,</hi> who was clothed in a long black Bayes Cloak, and his ſervants attending him in mourning, being mounted to the uppermoſt part of the Scaffold, he prayed for a good ſpace upon his knees, and then riſing up, asked, If there were no hopes of Pardon? which made the people with one voice cry out, <hi>No, let him die, let him die for a Traytor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next funebrious Ceremony of his Execution, was the Proclamation, which according to the uſual manner was made by the Executioner, in theſe words; <hi>This is the Juſtice that the King our Soveraign Lord, commands to be executed upon the perſon of</hi> Don Lewis de Meneſes, <hi>ſometimes Marqueſs of</hi> Villa-Real, <hi>that his throat be cut as a Traytor to his Majeſty, Nobility and People of this Kingdom, that for his Crime his goods be confiſcated, and his memory baniſhed out of the World.</hi> Whereat all the people cryed out, <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Marqueſs thereupon ſeeing no hopes of any Repreive, with a ſober and becoming gravity demanded Pardon of all the Spectators, deſiring them to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50649:66"/> aſſiſt him with their prayers to God for the Pardon of this, and all his other ſins; then turning to a Father-Jeſuite his Confeſſor, he prayed him in his behalf to preſent himſelf at his Majeſties feet, and beſeech him out of his wonted goodneſs, to forgive him that hainous offence committed againſt him and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>Having ended this Speech, he very patiently ſate down in the Chair, and the Executioner having tied his arms and legs, to the arms and legs of the Chair, he leaned his neck over the back of the Chair, and the Executioner with his knife cut his throat, covering him afterwards with a black Scarf.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame maner his ſon the Duke of <hi>Camigna</hi> came to the Scaffold, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants all attending him in mourning; as he came to his fathers Corps he kneeled down, and ſeveral times kiſſed his feet, begged of the people the ſuffrage of one <hi>Pater noſtre</hi> for his fathers ſoul; then after ſome prayers, and Proclamation made by the Executioner, he received the ſame puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Next that ſuffered was the Count of <hi>Armamac,</hi> in the Chair ſeated upon the lower ſtory; and after him <hi>Don Auguſtin Manuel</hi> upon the Scaffold it ſelf; the Judges would have had all their necks cut behind, but his Majeſty would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto, as a puniſhment too ignominious for perſons of their quality.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day <hi>Pietro de Baeza,</hi> and <hi>Melchior Correa de Franca,</hi> were drawn at a horſe-tail to an extraordinary high gallows, and there hanged, whileſt <hi>Diego de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Nabo,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Valente,</hi> were executed upon a lower; the Quarters of theſe four were ſet up at the Gates of the City, and their Heads placed upon ſeveral Frontier Towns.</p>
                     <p>In the Month of <hi>September</hi> following, for the ſame offence <hi>Antonia Cogamigne,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Correa,</hi> were likewiſe executed, the firſt of which during the whole time of his Impriſonment, was an example of Penitence, feeding only upon Bread and Water, and whipping himſelf very often, with continual prayers to God for Pardon of that, and all his other ſins.</p>
                     <p>As for the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Martiria</hi> and <hi>Malacca,</hi> and Fryer <hi>Emanuel de Macedo,</hi> though they were the perſons that had the greateſt hand in the Conſpiracy; yet in regard they were Eccleſiaſtical perſons, they ſuffered not death, according to their deſerts, but were kept in priſon, till the Popes pleaſure were known concerning them.</p>
                     <p>Here muſt not be forgot a great example of humility and repentance in the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> not only in his life time (when he often writ to the King, that he might ſuffer, and others be ſpared, who were rather drawn in, in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and obedience to him, than out of any ill-will to the King and Kingdom (but alſo at his death (which hapned about Three years after his Impriſonment) when he gave Order, That as ſoon as he was dead, his Laſt Will and Teſtament ſhould be carried to the King, wherein he humbly intreated his Majeſty to Pardon the Treaſon committed againſt him, and his Native Countrey, and that he would permit his body to be buried without the Church of any Pariſh of <hi>Lisbonne,</hi> and that without any Inſcription or Tomb-ſtone, that there might remain no memory of a man who had been a Traytor to his King and Countrey.</p>
                     <p>This exemplary puniſhment, and rigorous execution of Juſtice upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned trayterous Delinquents, eſtabliſhed the King in his Kingdom, ſtruck a terror into his enemies, and increaſed his Subjects love and care of him more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to Watch his Royal Families, and the Kingdoms ſafety.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time daily incurſions were made upon the Frontiers between the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> and <hi>Portugueſſes,</hi> with the ſame Violence, Cruelty and Animoſity, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and forty two</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50649:67"/> the Truce that had been concluded between <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and that a great Fleet of <hi>Hollanders</hi> had been ſent to aſſiſt the <hi>Portugal</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) there paſſed very high Acts of Hoſtility between the two Nations in <hi>Affrica</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> beyond the Line; for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeeing the diſunion of <hi>Portugal</hi> from <hi>Caſtille,</hi> made all ſpeed poſſible to perfect the Conqueſt of thoſe parts before a perfect Peace ſhould be concluded with <hi>Portugal,</hi> that ſo in the Treaty they might pretend Reaſon, that all things ſhould continue in the ſtate they were then found.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe, that is, the expediting their Conqueſt, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly (whileſt there was all quiet and peacable Commerce held between the two Nations in the Kingdom of <hi>Angola</hi>) ſurprized the <hi>Portugals</hi> that were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the place, Killed divers, and Robbed all of the great Wealth they there found; of which Perfidiouſneſs, as alſo of the Barbarous Uſage of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there taken, Complaints were made to the <hi>States General</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> but no Redreſs was granted; nor was the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> of Ability to force it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Affairs in <hi>Portugal</hi> were a little diſcompoſed by the general Diſcontent and Diſtaſte taken at the Secretary of State, <hi>Don Franciſco de Lucena:</hi> This man had lived a long time in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> till he was by <hi>Olivarez</hi> made Under-Secretary to <hi>Vaſconcellos;</hi> his Readineſs to Proclaim King JOHN, and his Abilities in the place, made the King continue him in it, repoſing in him ſo great a Confidence, That though ſome had Advertized his Majeſty that he kept Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the Court at <hi>Madrid,</hi> yet the King would not ſuſpect him, nor permit him to be brought to a Trial.</p>
                     <p>But about the middle of the Year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and forty three;</hi> the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Affairs of the Kingdom requiring a Convention of the Three Eſtates, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly refuſed all Acts that ſhould paſs the hands of Secretary <hi>Lucena,</hi> poſitively tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Majeſty, That until he were brought to Trial, no Acts ſhould Paſs in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Eſtates, nor any farther Proceedings be made.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty was very much Grieved hereat, yet prudently Reſolved to give his Subjects Satisfaction, by delivering up his Secretary to Juſtice; yet Reſolving he ſhould have a fair Trial, and to that purpoſe ſitting himſelf to hear the Witneſſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. Whileſt Proceſs was framed againſt the Secretary, ſome ſecret Advice came to his Majeſty, which cauſed the Impriſonment of the Brother, and Three Servants of the Secretary, together with an Engliſh Monck, and a Cavalier of the Habit; not long after, the Secretary was Arraigned and Condemned for betraying his Truth, in holding Correſpondence with the Enemy, and in neglecting timely to Advertiſe the Infanta <hi>Edward</hi> to retire out of <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp;c. and according to his Sentence, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in a Publick place in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where at his Death, he proteſted his Innocency touching any Treachery towards his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>The Death of the Secretary both pleaſed the People, and ſatisfied the Aſſembly of Eſtates, who now, according to his Majeſties Command, met on <hi>September</hi> 18. <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and forty three;</hi> and being all ſate, and his Majeſty ſeated in his Throne, <hi>D.

But certainly they will be no ground of Reprehenſion, (though much of Admiration) to him that ſhall Conſider how His Majeſty entred upon a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, exhauſted by the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> of Money and other Neceſſaries, for Offence or Defence, and yet how in leſs than a Year and an half, we ſhould want neither Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, nor Artillery, nor Horſe, nor Arms, nor Fortification, nor Armies upon the Frontiers, three Powerful Fleets put to Sea, divers Honorable, and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Ambaſſages, beſides many Secret (yet Neceſſary) Expences; all which will aſtoniſh any Underſtanding Man. Now to the end that the People may have full ſatisfaction, His Majeſty hath Commanded, That (before further Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) it be made appear Particularly how all the Money Received hath been laid out, and then it is Expected, and the preſent ſtate of Affairs Requireth, That we all Contribute Liberally, Conſidering that theſe Charges are but for a time, but our Liberties are for ever: That we ſhall never have a better opportunity to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our Enemy. That Nature teacheth, To Hazard an Arm, to Save the whole Body: The Merchants at Sea caſt away ſome part of their Goods ſometimes, to ſave the reſt; we are now on Ship-board in a Storm, our Goods, our Lives, our Liberties, our Honour, our Countrey, are all in Danger.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, the Barbarous Uſage of the King of <hi>Caſtille</hi> towards the Infante <hi>Don Edward,</hi> calls upon this Aſſembly for Revenge, that we ſpend not only our Money, but our Blood in Affection to Him, and that we make our Enemies ſpend theirs in Satisfaction for Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>This Speech of the Deans was ſpoken with ſo much Affection, that it ſtirred up and encouraged the States readily to give all Aſſiſtance imaginable, both for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing of Grievances, and for the Levying Arms, ſo that within a ſmall time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the King was in the Head of Twenty thouſand Foot, and Three thouſand Horſe, marching towards the Fronteirs of <hi>Caſtille.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whil'ſt theſe great preparations for Hoſtility were made, the Queen brought forth into the World a ſecond Son to His Majeſty, but firſt Child after he came to the Crown, which added to the Magnificence of his Chriſtning, he was named <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Theodoſio</hi> dying before his Father, ſucceeded in the Kingdom and is at preſent King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many Skirmiſhes had paſſed between the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> and <hi>Portugueſſes,</hi> many town, had been ſurprized, many lands waſted, but never happened a ſet-battel between them till in the year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and forty four,</hi> when both Armies met upon the Border of <hi>Portugal</hi> in a field called <hi>Campo Major.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army which for the moſt part conſiſted of ſtrangers, was under the Command of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50649:68"/> Marqueſs of <hi>Forrecuſa,</hi> and the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army conſiſting of Natives, and ſome few <hi>Hollanders,</hi> were commanded by <hi>Macchias de Albuquerque.</hi> This fight was maintained with all poſſible courage and reſolution on both ſides; but the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> being more numerous, eſpecially in horſe, at length put the whole <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Army in Diſorder, ſeized on their whole Artillery, and Baggage, and ſlew <hi>Albuquerques</hi> Horſe under him, took many Priſoners, and aſſured themſelves of an abſolute Victory. But Fortune which had thus favourably ſmiled upon them in the beginning of the Day, frowned as harſhly upon them in the Concluſion; for <hi>Albuquerque</hi> being re-mounted, Rallied again his ſcattered Forces, re-charged the purſuing <hi>Spaniards,</hi> put them to a total Rout, and purſued the Chaſe for above three Miles.</p>
                     <p>In this Battel the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> loſt One thouſand ſix hundred men upon the place, amongſt which were the Lieutenant General, the General of the Horſe, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Artillery, the Count <hi>de Montixo,</hi> five Camp-maſters, two Adjutants of Horſe, three Serjeant Majors, three and twenty Cornets, together with many Knights of the Order of St. <hi>James Calatrava</hi> and <hi>Alcantara:</hi> there were taken about Four thouſand Arms, and a thouſand Horſe.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſide there were not above Three hundred ſlain, among which were two Camp-maſters, one Serjeant Major, a Captain of Horſe, and eight of Foot, but many Noblemen, Commanders, and Officers taken Priſoners in the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were carried away by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their flight.</p>
                     <p>It was not long after this Battel, that the Marqueſs <hi>De Montalban,</hi> D. <hi>George Maſcaneras</hi> Lord Treaſurer, Preſident of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Eſtate, with ſome others, were impriſoned upon ſuſpition of a Conſpiracy againſt the King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> but it being upon Examination found, that the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cunningly raiſed, to deprive King JOHN of his moſt able Miniſters, and to make the World believe the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nobility were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with their King; they were ſet at Liberty, and their Honours fully repaired by a Proclamation of the Kings.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ceaſed not by all means and devices, which the Will and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the moſt wicked Stateſ-men could invent, not only to weaken the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſs</hi> Nation within it ſelf, by breeding diſcontents (if poſſible) between the King and the three Eſtates, but likewiſe to undervalue them, and make their credit be ſlighted and diſregarded by other Kingdoms and States, their Confederates and Allies.</p>
                     <p>Yet beſides theſe ſubtile Ambages, the King of <hi>Caſtille</hi> did not deſiſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to oppreſs this Kingdom by force of Arms; but not only the reſolved and immutable unity of the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> Nation, was a ſtrong Tower and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fortreſs againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Power, but ſo extreamly was the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> involved in Wars and Diſaſters on every ſide, that that vaſt Body was rather in a condition to crave help and aſſiſtance from others, than indeed to oppreſs them. For beſides the Wars in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which had put itſelf under the protection of the moſt potent King of <hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> which had proved ſo tedious and ſo chargeable a War to <hi>Spains;</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in this Kingdom, and in <hi>Germany,</hi> there happened ſeveral Commotions and popular Tumults in ſome of the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Dominions, which not only robbed the King of a preſent ſupply of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but were otherwiſe retardments to the proſecution of his Wars in other places.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe Commotions began in the Iſland of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gathering together in a tumultuous manner, forced the Vice-roy to take off all new Impoſts and Taxes which the Kings preſent neceſſities had enforced him to lay upon them. This encouraged their neighbours on the adjacent Continent, the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50649:68"/> Inhabitants of the Famous City of <hi>Naples,</hi> in hopes to rid themſelves of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to riſe in like manner in Arms; which they did, encouraged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by one <hi>Thomas Aniello,</hi> or vulgarly <hi>Maſaniello,</hi> who though of ſo mean and obſcure a birth as a poor Fiſher-boy; yet to the wonder of the World for ten dayes Commanded this mighty City, and freed it from all Gabels, ſo that ever ſince theſe two Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> have rather been a great charge, than any benefit to the Spaniſh Monarch.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Troubles, and the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Families being every where encompaſſed and embroiled in Wars, together with the earneſt deſire of the King of <hi>Caſtille</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a vigorous War againſt <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> were I ſuppoſe the motives which perſwaded the Catholique King to end thoſe Wars, which had laſted in the low Countreys for above ninety years, by owning now at laſt (what he had ſo long refuſed) the united Provinces free States, ſo an obſolute peace was concluded on, and proclaimed at all the chief towns in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> on the 5. of <hi>June, One thouſand ſix hundred and forty eight,</hi> a Peace no leſs advantagious to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> than diſadvantagious to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> by reaſon of the pretences the <hi>Dutch</hi> had to <hi>Brazil,</hi> and other places in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> King JOHN of <hi>Portugal</hi> about the beginning of the year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and forty nine,</hi> thought his Son the Prince <hi>Theodoſio</hi> arrived at an age fitting to keep a Court of himſelf; Lodgings were therefore appointed for him, divided from the Royal Palace, and Officers of his Houſhold nominated and appointed by the King, amongſt whom the Earls of <hi>Villa nova,</hi> of <hi>Miranda,</hi> of <hi>Valdereis</hi> &amp; <hi>Fernando, Telles de Monezez,</hi> (who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been Governour of the City of <hi>Port,</hi>) were entruſted as the principal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his Chamber.</p>
                     <p>The King likewiſe thought fit to adde a third to the two former Superintendants of his Revenue, whom he nominated to be <hi>D. Rey de Moure Tellez,</hi> whoſe former Office of Steward to the Queen, was at the ſame time conferred on <hi>D. Antonio de Silva</hi> Lord of <hi>Billas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the Truce, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſtill continued their outrages on the other ſide the Line, but principally in <hi>Brazil,</hi> where they ſeized upon many of the <hi>Portugal</hi> ſorts, impeded the Traffick, abuſed and murthered the Subjects, which made His Majeſty reſolve to call the Earl of <hi>Caſtle Melhor</hi> from his charge of being General of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Forces upon the Frontiers of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> and committing that to the young <hi>Viſcount de Villanova de Servera</hi> that the Earl might be imployed as Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy to <hi>Brazil</hi> to curb the <hi>Flemmings</hi> inſolencies, and to ſecure the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships from their Pyracies, the King appointed a Fleet of forty Ships of War, and ſix thouſand Men to attend that ſervice as Convoys.</p>
                     <p>His Holineſs the Popes anger as yet continued towards the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for he had not only hitherto refuſed to receive Ambaſſadors from thence, but to ſupply thoſe Archbiſhopricks, Biſhopricks, and other Eccleſiaſtical Offices of the Kingdom, which by the death of the former poſſeſſors were vacant: this the King found a great inconveniency in, and therefore thought fit once more to attempt his Holineſs; and to preſent him the names of ſuch of his own Subjects, whoſe piety, learning, or other ſufficiencies he thought might make them capable of ſuch digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; As firſt, for the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Braga,</hi> (formerly acknowledged to be the primacy of all <hi>Spain,</hi> notwithſtanding the pretenſions of <hi>Toledo</hi>) he nominated <hi>Don Pedro de Lancaſtro,</hi> Preſident of the Juſtice of the Palace of the Houſe of <hi>Ameiro,</hi> and deſcended from JOHN the ſecond King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> For the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Evora,</hi> His Majeſty nominated <hi>D. Franciſco Barrez</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garez,</hi> Biſhoprick he beſtowed upon the Father <hi>Dennis Des Anges</hi> an Auguſtine Monk, and Confeſſor to His Majeſty: for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Guarda</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>D.

Pedro de Menerez,</hi> once named Biſhop of <hi>Miranda,</hi> of which laſt place <hi>D. Pedro de Porros</hi> Tutor of the Prince <hi>D. Theodoſio</hi> was now named Biſhop. Theſe choices of his Majeſty, the Pope after ſome time Confirmed <hi>D.

                     </p>
                     <p>But in the middeſt of this ſetling of Eccleſiaſtical affairs, Arms were not ſilent, for upon the Borders there hapned a Skirmiſh between the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> about the latter end of <hi>April, One thouſand ſix hundred forty and nine,</hi> Lord of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Court,</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Horſe, and Monſieur <hi>Du Queſne</hi> the Commiſſary General gained a Victory over a ſmall Army of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating Seven hundred of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and taking divers Priſoners, amongſt whom was the Nephew of the Marqueſs of <hi>Melinguen</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Army at <hi>Badajox,</hi> who was after exchanged for the Count <hi>Fieſque Lauagna,</hi> who for ſome years paſt had been Priſoner in <hi>Caſtille:</hi> in this Conflict the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> loſt but Twenty five men, the Chief of which was <hi>Sieur de la Touche,</hi> a French Captain, who had behaved himſelf moſt Valorouſly.</p>
                     <p>The Commotions of the <hi>Periſians</hi> againſt the King of <hi>France,</hi> had given the <hi>Spaniard</hi> great hopes of better ſucceſs than they had many years had, but the middle of the Year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and forty nine,</hi> happily concluding them, the news of their Pacification, and that of a great Victory gained by the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> againſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in <hi>Brazile,</hi> cauſed a general joy over all <hi>Portugal;</hi> for the King appointed Publick Thanks to be given, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be Sung in all Churches.</p>
                     <p>Hopes to revenge the late defeat given by the Lord <hi>Therimicourt,</hi> and deſire to do ſome Valiant Act before he departed from his Government, made the Marqueſs of <hi>Leganez</hi> Governour of the Spaniſh Forces at <hi>Eſtramadura,</hi> give an Alarum to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Frontiers, and enter into the Countrey with Two thouſand Horſe, and Six thouſand Foot, but the Valiant Count of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> aſſaulting him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to retire with ſhame, and excuſe himſelf that he marched out only to meet the Marqueſs of <hi>Mortare,</hi> who was appointed to ſucceed him in the Government.</p>
                     <p>Yet this ſmall and worthleſs Alarum, made the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who knew that too much care could not be had of the Safety of his Kingdom, to ſend Orders to the Governors to look more exactly to the Countreys committed to their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, than formerly, and ſtrictly to give Charge to <hi>Don Juan de Menezez</hi> Governor of <hi>Porto.</hi> The Viſcount <hi>Ponte de Lima</hi> Governor of the Countreys between <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and <hi>Mimbo,</hi> to the Count of <hi>Arogna</hi> Governor of <hi>Traſmontes,</hi> and <hi>Don Roderigo de Caſtro</hi> Governor of <hi>Beira,</hi> to repair with all expedition to their ſeveral Commands.</p>
                     <p>Nor was his Majeſty leſs careful of his Dominions abroad, than of thoſe near home, which made him diſpatch the Baron of <hi>Alviro</hi> to be Governor of <hi>Tanger,</hi> and D. <hi>Franciſco de Norogna</hi> to <hi>Mazagan,</hi> both ſtrong Forts in <hi>Affrica;</hi> the laſt of which had been neer ſurprized by the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Barbary,</hi> but the Commander of that Party which aſſaulted it, being ſlain by a Valorous French-man, they were beaten off with loſs, for which ſervice the King beſtowed upon the French-man a Penſion of Six hundred Crowns <hi>per annum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whil'ſt His Majeſty was diſtributing his Bounties, he could not forget the Lady Dona <hi>Maria Manuel,</hi> Widow to the ſome-time before deceaſed <hi>D. Antonio Coello, D.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50649:69"/> into <hi>France,</hi> to renew the Alliance, and conclude a firm League between the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth King of <hi>France;</hi> His Majeſty therefore in conſideration of his ſervices, beſtowed a valuable Penſion on his afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Widow.</p>
                     <p>There was almoſt daily in-roads made upon the Frontiers in ſome places or other, amongſt the reſt, the Baron of <hi>Themericourt</hi> entred with a ſtrong Party into the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Territories, ſurpriſed the Suburbs of the City of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> and brought away a very rich Booty, without the loſs of ſo much as one Souldier upon the place, and not above Twenty wounded.</p>
                     <p>The ſuccour of the diſtreſſed Subjects of the more diſtreſſed King of <hi>England,</hi> about the Year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and fifty,</hi> gave occaſion to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to manifeſt his affection to the Engliſh Nation, which he did by giving aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the Gallant Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who being by His Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> made Admiral of thoſe few Ships which in the Year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and forty eight,</hi> returned to their Allegiance, had ever ſince been purſued by the more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Fleets of the Engliſh Rebels, and was now by them driven to ſeek the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his <hi>Portugal</hi> Majeſty, who notwithſtanding that the Fleet of the Rebels with threatning <hi>Bravado's,</hi> demanded the ſaid Kings leave, either to aſſault them in his Port, or to force them to come out bravely, protected them under his Caſtles.</p>
                     <p>In Revenge of which, the Rebels of <hi>England,</hi> who ſtiled themſelves a Parliament, Proclaimed an open War with the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, which his Majeſty, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great Engagement at that preſent, both againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at home, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> on the other ſide the Line, reſolved to endure, rather than deliver up the faithful Subjects of <hi>England</hi> into the hands of Murther, Tyranny, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and therefore in part to cry quittance with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had taken Prize ſeveral Ships belonging to this Nation, he made ſeizure of all the Engliſh Ships and Goods within his whole Dominions, but only thoſe he had before Protected.</p>
                     <p>But at length Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> finding a clear Paſſage from out his Ports, where he had for many Months been blocked up, the King, by Reaſon of his other large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in defence of his Kingdom, finding himſelf unable to maintain a War againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and Nature dictating us to the Preſervation of our Selves, Reſolved, more moved out of Neceſſity, than Inclination, to ſend an Agent into <hi>England</hi> to conclude a Peace.</p>
                     <p>The Perſon deputed to go on this unpleaſant Employment (<hi>viz.</hi> to Court Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels) was <hi>D.

                           <p>The King my Maſter ſends me to continue and preſerve our common and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient peace, whereof I am to make a tender unto the Parliament of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England</hi> in His Majeſties behalf, as proceeding from a perfect ſincerity in his Royal breaſt, and whereunto he is chiefly drawn by the Motive of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular eſteem and love, he bears unto this Engliſh Nation.</p>
                           <p>And this, as the main point I ſhall recommend unto you, both in regard of your greater good and ours, and as a thing of higheſt concernment, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how little it can be pleaſing to Almighty God, and how derogatory it muſt needs be to our reputation on both ſides, to give the leaſt beginning of diſcord between two Chriſtian Nations, ſo well affected to one another as we are.</p>
                           <p>It is manifeſt unto the Parliament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> and to all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides; in how wonderful a manner (ſuch as was only poſſible to God, the King my Maſter was reſtored to his Kingdoms, and how the Divine Majeſty (whoſe handy-work this was) doth by his eſpecial care and grace defend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this Reſtoration.</p>
                           <p>Which as it doth dayly more appear by the victories we have over our enemies at home, ſo again it is ſeen in our remoteſt and moſt diſtantial dominions in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> where even at a huge diſtance (His Majeſty poſſeſſing the hearts of his people) enjoyes the greateſt peace in the world, and is ſecure in <hi>Affrica</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying therein upon his proſperous and happy powers.</p>
                           <p>To conclude, the King my Maſter, leſt any thing ſhould be wanting to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him compleatly happy, hath (according to the wiſh of an ancient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Author, for ſecuring the proſperity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) a faithful Senate, puiſſant Armies, and a moſt obedient people, Fortifications in the judgement of wiſeſt politicians, conducing and neceſſary both to defend and increaſe Empires and Kingdoms.</p>
                           <p>Now in this good condition of not only gaining and conſerving friends, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of vanquiſhing our enemies, the King my Maſter loves and embraces peace, as the chiefeſt good amongſt humane things, holding it forth to all Kingdoms and Commonwealths, but eſpecially to this of <hi>England,</hi> with that exceeding good will which he hath hitherto born, and ſhall ever bear unto the ſame, ſtanding thereunto obliged by ſuch bonds of love and good offices, as ſhall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by His Majeſty.</p>
                           <p>For the people of this Nation are the moſt worthy ſucceſſors of thoſe their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Anceſtors, who by their juſt power and Arms came freely to vindicate our
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50649:70"/> Crowns from the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> oppreſſions. And are, if not the ſame perſons, at leaſt their Children, who inflamed with a fervor and zeal of defending the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> juſtly did diſdain to ſee it in the unjuſt poſſeſſion of a forreign Prince.</p>
                           <p>They are, I ſay, thoſe who with ſo mature deliberation and reſolution, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſnatch away this undue poſſeſſion from the ſaid Uſurper, maugre the concurrence of ſome ill-affected <hi>Portugals</hi> with our enemies; and that they might atchieve this end glorious to themſelves, and to us emolumental, they are thoſe who covered theſe as with their Squadrons and Fleets of Ships, ever formidable to their moſt potent enemies by a new example of an unheard of valour (had our unfortunate Stars then given us leave to be happy) come up to the very walls of <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And this having formerly been between us and them moſt powerful Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and our moſt loving brethren, now that the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> (for which you have fought ſo valiantly, when it was unlawfully detained, is happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the poſſeſſion of the natural, and lawful King to whom of right it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains) who would not admire to ſee you bend your equal power, (upon no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion given) againſt the true and rightful King of <hi>Portugal</hi> by joyning with, and favouring the ſame Uſurper (beaten by us) from whom your ſelves did heretofore by force of your own Arms in our behalfs endeavor to ſnatch and wreſt away that Crown he had unjuſtly ſeized upon, and whom indeed you have hitherto both in deſire and effect oppoſed.</p>
                           <p>It would to all the world ſeem a thing much removed from the innate genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and gallantry of this your Nation, and very ill ſuiting with your Chriſtian juſtice and equality, as alſo it would be a very unworthy requital of us (who have deſerved better at your hands) and of that benevolence and affection wherewith the whole Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> is paſſionately carrying on towards you, wiſhing unto you the ſame happineſſe that we our ſelves deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
                           <p>Let therefore theſe imaginary Clouds of diſcord vaniſh, and be quite blown over from our thoughts, as ſerving only to Eclipſe with darkneſs, the clear light of our antient amity, which (with what intention God Almighty knows,) the importune ſagacity of our Common enemy would fain deprive us of.</p>
                           <p>Let all obſtacles be removed, and thrown quite away, wherewith the true ſerving polititians by their inbred ambition of an univerſal Monarchy do conſpire the ruine of us both, aiming at nothing more then to ſet us together by the ears, that overthrowing each other with our own Wars, we may have breaſts open (when our powers are exhauſted) to their ſwords and wounds, with greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt our ſelves, and leſs hazard unto them.</p>
                           <p>This new Republique is built upon ſtrong and ſure foundations, as alſo our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and reſtored Kingdoms, let us therefore caſt our eyes unto the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our cauſe, joyning hands, and mutual benevolence to ſuch effect, as may render both parties ſecurity, the greater forbearing, and bewaring above all things, all provocations, or irruptions of War, whereby (beſides the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and loſſes which they ever draw after them,) all our own affairs and ſafety may be hazarded extreamly, while their councels and endeavors will be promoted, who by hidden and wicked arts, ſtrive to extend their own power by the common waſte they would make in ours.</p>
                           <p>The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> my Maſter, hath ſent me hither furniſhed with a firm ample plenipotentiary power, that diſcuſſing, and ſcrewing all the juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient means, I may confer about the conſervation of Peace, and (removing all emergent obſtacles and ſcruples) reſolve, and eſtabliſh with the Parliament of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50649:71"/> the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> whatſoever ſhall be neceſſary for compoſing of our preſent affairs, and maturely to provide with the greateſt ſecurity that may be poſſible, for their future well-being.</p>
                           <p>I therefore beſeech the Parliament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> that weighing and conſidering theſe things which I have exhibited, they would pleaſe to decree whatſoever ſhall ſeem to them moſt convenient and juſt.</p>

                     <p>To this large Speech of forced and known flattery, if we reſpect it in relation to the perſons it was ſpoke to, (though moſt true in thoſe particulars relating to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation whil'ſt monarchical) was anſwered by the Rebels, with a large Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range of the injuries they ſuppoſed done them by the protection of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Fleet, and ſeizure of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Ships and Goods, concluding that they muſt have reparation made them for the publique damage of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which they would be willing to accept of in any honourable manner, and were willing to that purpoſe, if the Ambaſſador had ſufficient power to treat with him to that effect.</p>
                     <p>In ſumme, after ſome time the Count <hi>Del Sa</hi> Lord Chamberlain of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Portugal</hi> arrived in <hi>England,</hi> in the quality of an Ambaſſador extraordinary, who after many Conferences, Addreſſes, and large Offers made, obtained a Peace, upon condition to repay great Summes of money towards the ſatisfaction of the loſſes of the Engliſh Merchants.</p>
                     <p>During the ſtay of this Ambaſſador, his brother <hi>D. Pantaleon Sa,</hi> Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> led by I know not what frantick madneſſe, made a great uproar upon the New Exchange in <hi>London,</hi> where ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> were by him and his Followers, murdered; for which ſeveral of his retinue were hanged, and himſelf, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the earneſt ſolicitations of his brother, afterwards beheaded on Tower-hill, when the government of <hi>England</hi> was changed from a ſtrange kinde of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to a ſtranger kind of Monarchy, under a Protector.</p>
                     <p>But to return back again to the affairs of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Caſtle Melhor</hi> who had been ſent Vice-Roy into <hi>Brazil,</hi> had ſo good ſucceſs, that with the aſſiſtance of thoſe <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> before in the Kingdom, he expulſed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> out of all their Garriſons there, except the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Recif,</hi> which was built upon a Rock wholly invironed by the Sea. This animated the United States of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> to endeavor a revenge and recovery of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to that end and purpoſe, a Potent Fleet was ſet out, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very earneſt endeavors, and large offers of the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> Ambaſſador at the <hi>Hague,</hi> ſet ſail to reconquer that Kingdom, but not with that ſucceſs which was expected, for the expedition proved wholly fruitleſs, and after ſo great an expence, the States were ſo highly diſcontented, that the Admiral <hi>Wittiſon</hi> was arreſted at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to anſwer ſuch things as ſhould be objected againſt him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that voyage.</p>
                     <p>It much concerns that King who hath to deal with enemies too potent for him, to ſtrengthen himſelf with ſuch Alliance, as may moſt advantage him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage his Foe; This conſideration made King JOHN of <hi>Portugal,</hi> about the year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and fifty two,</hi> ſend an Ambaſſador to the young Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> (who by reaſon of the ſcituation of his Country, had good and frequent opportunities to annoy the Catholique King,) and divert him from turning his whole Force upon this Kingdom) offering reciprocal Marriage between that Duke and his Daughter, and the young Prince <hi>Theodoſia</hi> and <hi>Savoys</hi> Siſter. But this his intention, was I ſuppoſe diverted, if not wholly hindred by the great power of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who deſigned one of his Nieces as a fit match for <hi>Eugenius</hi> young Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>

                     <p>'Tis not at all ſafe nor fit for a ſubject to grow too rich, at leaſt not to exceed his Soveraign in Treaſure, for he thereby layes himſelf open to the envie and ſuſpition of his Prince, nor is it poſſible that any who hath managed a publick imployment, can be ſo without faults, as that ſomewhat cannot be laid to his charge to render him at a Kings mercy.</p>
                     <p>Sufficient example of this we have in <hi>D. Phillip de Maſcarendas</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Goa</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> who having for many years officiated in that high imployment, had gathered up an infinite Maſs of Riches, and now being called home, thought in peace and quiet to enjoy what with a penurious and induſtrious hand he had been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ſtoring up: but the King being informed that he had indeed ſuch a vaſte trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Gold, Diamonds, Pearls and other Jewels, as he could not with his own honor or ſafety permit a Subject to enjoy, eaſily found out them who were ready to form complaints againſt him, which were as readily liſtned to by the Kings Council, who preſently drawing up a charge againſt him, for having uſed an arbitrary power, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and abuſed the Subjects, and Merchants trading thither, &amp;c. cauſed the Ship wherein he came, with all the riches laden on it, to be ſeized on for the Kings uſe, and himſelf for ſome time impriſoned, nor had it been a wonder if he had made a forfeiture of his life, as well as of the greateſt part of his eſtate.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrength of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at Sea, had been the greateſt obſtacle to the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> not wholly regaining their ancient poſſeſſion in <hi>Brazile,</hi> but the Wars wherein the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had involved themſelves with <hi>England,</hi> proving ſo powerful a diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> took the advantage to reduce <hi>Recif,</hi> which with ſeveral Forts that encompaſſed it, and ſome few other, were the only places that held out againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Againſt this therefore with a ſufficient Land-force, came <hi>Don Franciſco Barreto,</hi> Governor of <hi>Pernambuco,</hi> (whil'ſt the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Navy conſiſting of 65. Sayl, blocked it up by ſea,) and firſt by ſtorm took the Fort of <hi>Salines,</hi> and thence coming before that of <hi>Burracco,</hi> found it already abandoned, and blown up by the defendants: he next proceeded to the new Fortreſs, the next and ſtrongeſt Fort to that of <hi>Recif,</hi> and well manned and munitioned. Thus having made a ſturdy reſiſtance, was at length forced by the <hi>Portugal,</hi> which ſo amazed the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that though they had fifteen hundred men, and ſix months proviſions in <hi>Recif,</hi> yet they agreed to yield it upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable terms on the 26 of <hi>January</hi> 1654. being twenty four years after they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it from the <hi>Portugals.</hi>

                     <p>THE Conditions upon which this ſtrong Fortreſs was ſurrendred up, were to this effect.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>That they ſhould have ſufficient number of ſhips able to paſs the Equinoctial Line, with Iron-guns for their Tranſportation.</hi>

                     <p>Nor were the <hi>Portugals</hi> at home leſs fortunate againſt their neighbour enemy the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for to omit many petty skirmiſhes, in-roads made by them with all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs deſirable in the ſummer, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and fity four, D.

Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco De Ferrara Rabella</hi> arrived in <hi>England,</hi> with Commiſſion from the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> as Agent, to <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> who then ſwayed here under the title of Protector, to make a more firm confirmation of the Peace with <hi>England,</hi> and to adviſe, I ſuppoſe, about carrying on the War with <hi>Spain;</hi> which when <hi>Cromwel</hi> had given ſome reaſons to make the world believe he would commence againſt that Catholick Monarch, and how much ſuch a War was for the Intereſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> none will doubt who have read the foregoing ſtory, which made King JOHN Court that Engliſh Uſurper with more Submiſsneſs and Complacency, by both harbouring his Fleets, and ſending Preſents to his Generals, than otherwiſe his <hi>Genius</hi> would have permitted him to have done, any way in prejudice of <hi>Englands</hi> lawful KING. In the mean time the death of Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the Tenth, made D. <hi>Franciſco de Souza,</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> for the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> make new Addreſſes to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Seventh his Succeſſor, for Confirmation of the Church-Officers in that Kingdom; for he never had any full Grant from <hi>Innocent;</hi> but now the Spaniſh Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors oppoſed themſelves more than ever, and by means of the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who wholly imployed her intereſt for the benefit of that Nation, endeavoured to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate even the <hi>Portugueſses</hi> Hopes; nay, ſo deſperate was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Malice, That they laid ſeveral Deſigns to murder the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſadour, but all proved ineffectual. In ſum, After D. <hi>Franciſco de Souza,</hi> had ſpent ſome years in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to very little purpoſe, he was, upon the death of King JOHN the Fourth, called home to be Governour of the young King <hi>Alphonſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The proffered interchangeable Match with <hi>Savoy,</hi> not taking effect, father <hi>Du Rozaire,</hi> a Dominican, and Arch-biſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> was ſent Agent to <hi>France,</hi> to treat about a Marriage between that King, and the Infanta <hi>Donna Catharina,</hi> with Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Three Millions of Gold for Her Portion, and that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> would for Seven Years maintain Eighteen Men of War at Sea, for the defence and ſervice of the French Crown.</p>
                     <p>Long was this Buſineſs in Negotiation, and by many thought would have taken effect, the Agent being very highly carreſſed both by the King and Queen-mother of <hi>France;</hi> but whether by reaſon of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s diſlike of it, or other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50649:73"/> of State, it was prolonged by continual demurs, till after the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>'s Death, and then wholly broken off.</p>
                     <p>For King JOHN being now arrived to about Fifty years of Age, in the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of his Reign,<note place="margin">His Death. 1656.</note> and in the Year of our Lord, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and fifty ſix,</hi> on the Sixth of <hi>November, S.

                     <p>Before his Death, he appointed <hi>Donna Lucia</hi> his Queen, to be Regent of the Kingdom during the minority of D. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> her Son, recommending to her for Aſſiſtants in the management of ſo great burden as a Crown, the Reverend D. <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> Don <hi>Runlio</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Niſa,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Canvandake,</hi> and ſome others, whoſe abilities, love and fidelity, he had experience of.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He was a Perſon of a very comely preſence, his Countenance pleaſant, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to Swarthineſs, his Body about a middle ſtature, yet comely and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, nor were the lineaments of his mind leſs becoming, than thoſe of his Body, though if ye believe common fame, he was none of the wiſeſt Kings that ever <hi>Portugal</hi> could boaſt of: the reaſon that he left ſo much of the Reins of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to his Wife, a Woman of a Maſculine and Politick ſpirit, from whence perhaps that jeſting <hi>Spaniard</hi> might take occaſion to ſay; <hi>That it was not the</hi> Portugal <hi>force, but the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>policy, that kept that Kingdom from the Catholique King,</hi> alluding to the Queens being a <hi>Spaniard.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Not long after, by an Expreſs from <hi>England</hi> from the King to Her, the Infanta KATHERINE was Complemented with the ſtile of Queen of <hi>GREAT BRITAIN;</hi> and then, with what poſſible Speed could be made, was expected for <hi>England,</hi> all things being prepared in a readineſs for ſo great a Princeſs, and ſo long a Voyage: Then upon the Thirteenth day of <hi>April,</hi> this preſent year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred threeſcore and two,</hi> She paſſed with the King Her Brother, the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and the whole Court, unto the ſide of the River <hi>Tagus,</hi> through ſeveral Triumphal Arches, and a ſumptuous Gallery built upon that Occaſion, where Her MAJESTY was received by the Earle of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who conducted Her on Board a ſtately <hi>Brigandine,</hi> whence amidſt many Tire and Vollies of Cannon, and many more farewel Acclamations in the ſame Princely Company and Equipage, Her MAJESTY came aboard the <hi>ROYAL CHARLES,</hi> and was welcomed with the Thunder of the whole Navy.</p>
                        <p>In the Evening, after a Princely Collation, and many paſſionate parting Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a Gun from the Admiral gave the Signal of Her MAJESTIES Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to depart, when all hands were ſet on work to weigh Anchor, and let flie their Sails.</p>
                        <p>The King and Queen-Mother, and their Train, took their Farewel with hearts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually compoſed of Grief and Joy, and Re-imbarqued for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> returning with the diſcharge of all the Ordnance; and ſo immediately with a fair leading Gale, the whole Fleet began their Courſe, being, as they paſſed out of the River, ſaluted by all the Block-houſes, Forts and Caſtles. That Night, and part of the next Day, the Wind ſtood very propitious; but afterwards proved averſe and ſtormy, ſo that they were forced to labour to and fro with contrary Winds, it being the Six and twentieth of <hi>April</hi> when they got into the middle of the Bay of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> Her MAJESTY, by the continual working and toſſing of the Sea, having been ſick the moſt part of the Voyage.

On <hi>Sunday</hi> morning about Ten of the Clock, they diſcovered the <hi>ROYAL JAMES;</hi> but there was ſo great a Calm, they could not reach the <hi>ROYAL CHARLES</hi> till Six at Evening. The Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> having diſcovered His Highneſs <hi>YAUGH,</hi> went out in his Barge to meet Him, the Royal Banner being all the while vailed till He was aboard, when His Highneſs came into the Ship, the Souldiers gave Three ſeveral Shouts, and all the Guns in the <hi>ROYAL CHARLES</hi> (which from the Queens entrance till that time had been ſilent) proclaimed His Welcome; after which, the ſeveral Ships of the Fleet paid Him their Salutes. The Thirteenth of <hi>May</hi> at night, the Royal Fleet came to St. <hi>Helens</hi> Point, the moſt Eaſtern Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> and on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>May,</hi> the Queen landed at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> about Four of the Clock in the Afternoon, where She was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Nobility, Gentry, and multitudes of <hi>Londoners;</hi> as alſo by the Mayor and Aldermen of that Corporation with all the Expreſſions of Joy.</p>
                        <p>His MAJESTY having received the Expreſs of His Queens landing, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be gone forthwith to Salute Her upon Her Arrival: But His great Affairs of State, and Bills by Him to be Ratified into Acts of Parliament, which were not fully ready for His Royal Aſſent, delayed him till <hi>Monday</hi> the Nineteenth of <hi>May</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent before Him the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who departed the Seventeenth, in order to the Solemnizing of the Marriage) when He took Coach from the Houſe of Lords at Nine of the Clock in the Evening with His ordinary Guards, and lodged that night at <hi>Gilford;</hi> the next day His MAJESTY poſted with the ſame ſpeed to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where He arrived about Noon.</p>
                        <p>The Queens indiſpoſition which yet held Her in Her Chamber, cauſed the King to ſatisfie Himſelf only with a Viſit in private that day: Yet it pleaſed God to reſtore Her Majeſty to ſuch a degree of health, that ſhe was ſoon after able to go abroad to conſummate the Marriage-Rites, which were there performed upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 21. of <hi>May,</hi> by <hi>Gilbert</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> which being concluded, His Majeſty Bedded His moſt Princely Lady in His Town of <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> The next Week their Majeſties removed to <hi>Winchester,</hi> thence to <hi>Farnham,</hi> and then to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, where They ſpent moſt part of this Summer; as well for the Healthfulneſs, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Place.</p>
                        <p>Then on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 23. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> (being the Eve of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> a Day Remarkable for its Beauty, being the Faireſt of Ten that either came before, or followed it,) after Dinner, the King and Queen took Barge in order to Their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment by the City of <hi>London</hi> upon the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and came to <hi>Putney</hi> about Four of the Clock in the Evening, where They changed Their ſpare Barge, and were by the Lord Chamberlain conducted on Board that Barge which was prepared to bring Them to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> in which They were placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, adorned with Five Plumes of White and Yellow Oſtrich-Feathers; the Barge lined alſo with Cloth of Gold, and Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſame, the two Gondeloes went on either ſide, before, in which were His Majeſties Trumpets which ſounded continually. At <hi>Chelſey</hi> Their Majeſties were met by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen in their Barge, afterwards by all the Companies in their Barges with loud Muſick, all adorned with their ſeveral Banners and Pennons of Arms: I cannot ſpend time to particularize the ſeveral Pageants and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50649:74"/> Repreſentations of the <hi>Mercers, Drapers, Merchant-Taylors, Goldſmiths,</hi> &amp;c. being neither poſſible, nor proper for this place; therefore I ſhall only ſay (which none but the abſent will deny) That the oldeſt perſon alive never ſaw the <hi>Thames</hi> more fully, nor more Nobly covered. Amid'ſt a Throng of a Thouſand Boats, and more than Ten thouſand joyful Subjects, Their Majeſties landed at <hi>Whitehall</hi> about 7. of the Clock in the Evening, where the moſt Excellent Princeſs the Queen Mother, and the Dutcheſs of <hi>York,</hi> gave Her Majeſty Her Welcome; which was ſeconded by a Tere of Artillary Planted at <hi>Stangate-Wharf</hi> over againſt <hi>Whitehall</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the ſame Night, afterwards being made an Artificial Day, by the Number of Bone-fires and Fire-works.</p>
                        <p>I omit to fix a Character upon the Goodneſs and Beauty of this our Royal Queen, as deſerving a larger Room, and an abler Pen, or to ſpeak of that Portion, ſtore of Money and Jewels, as great as ever any Princeſs brought a Husband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will not preſume to meddle with thoſe ſublime particulars. As alſo of thoſe Advantages that the Engliſh Merchant receives by the Trade of both the <hi>Indies</hi> where the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> over-rule the Dutch; and by the commodious ſituation of <hi>Tangier</hi> for the checking and curbing the Inſolencies of the Pirates of <hi>Algier, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> if at any time they break their League with <hi>England,</hi> it being a place ſituate upon the mouth of the Streight of <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> ſo that no Ship can paſs that Streight, without Licence firſt had from the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> who upon this Account Commands the whole Trade of the Levant.</p>
                        <p>May we long enjoy Their Majeſties with the Bleſſings we have received with Them, and from Them a continued Line of Great <hi>Britains</hi> Kings, that we may not want a Soveraign to Reign over us, who derives his Goodneſs, as well as Greatneſs, from this our Soveraign Pair.</p>

                     <p>The whole Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> was in a kind of amaze at the ſo ſudden death of Kng <hi>John,</hi> eſpecially conſidering the youth of their preſent King, fearing leſt their common Enemies ſhould now take advantage of them: but the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent management of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſs of State by the Queen Regent, ſoon baniſhed all thoſe fancied fears.</p>
                     <p>The Queen being ſenſible, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion of the Kings death, ſhe ſhould have moſt occaſion to uſe the Souldiery, by the Advice of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, Ordered all the Infantry of the Kingdom ſhould have Half a years pay, the better to encourage them, who were of themſelves ready enough to fight againſt their common and inveterate Enemy, the <hi>Caſtillians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe ſhe knew that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would loſe no opportunity to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſhe thought it imprudence to let any ſlip where an advantage might be gained upon him, and therefore all the Spaniſh Forces being drawn out of <hi>Andaluzia</hi> to oppoſe the Engliſh, in caſe they ſhould attempt to land
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50649:75"/> at <hi>Cadiz;</hi> (for they then blocked up that Port with a Potent Fleet,) ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Four thouſand Horſe to make an in-road into that Countrey, who plundered, and laid waſte all before them, bringing away between Forty and fifty thouſand head of Cattel, and leaving the whole Soil in a manner deſolate.</p>
                     <p>This ſo exaſperated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> That draining moſt of the Gariſons of his Kingdom, he raiſed a Potent Army, and with Ten thouſand Foot, and Five thouſand Horſe entred <hi>Portugal,</hi> and laid Siege to the ſtrong City of <hi>Olivenza,</hi> which at length they reduced to that neceſſity, that the Defendants were willing to Capitulate, and ſounded a Parlie, but when they came to treat, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not admit the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> any other Title, than that of Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> which made the <hi>Portugals</hi> renounce any farther treating.</p>
                     <p>But at length the <hi>Spaniards</hi> condeſcending to treat, the Town was delivered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Articles; but ſo much did the Queen-Regent and Council of <hi>Portugal</hi> reſent it, that they immediately gave Order to Arreſt the Perſon of Don <hi>Mandiol de Saldagna</hi> the Governour, who (with ſeveral of his chief Officers,) was by the Count <hi>de St. Lorenze,</hi> General of the <hi>Portugueſſe</hi> Forces in thoſe parts, ſent Priſoners to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> there to anſwer their ill-defending of that Town, it appearing, That at the ſurrendring of it, there marched out Two thouſand two hundred well Armed Foot, and One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe; nor were they reduced to that neceſſity that was pretended, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Stores of Ammunition and Proviſion, ſufficient to have defended the Town a great while longer.</p>
                     <p>The loſs of this Place was a great blow to the <hi>Portugueſſes,</hi> it being a ſtrong Frontier Town, and giving the <hi>Spaniard</hi> abſolute Command a great way into the Countrey; but this the King of <hi>Spain</hi> reſolved ſhould be but a beginning of his Conqueſt (if poſſible) of this Kingdom, for he ſtill made all preparations he could to aſſault it with a greater force, and not only endeavoured this with might and main to oppreſs it himſelf, but by his Ambaſſadors ſolicited the States General of the United Provinces to ſend their Vice-Admiral <hi>Opdam,</hi> with the Fleet he then had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Dantzick,</hi> into <hi>Portugal,</hi> to demand ſatisfaction for the damage the <hi>Portugals</hi> had done to their <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company in <hi>Brazil,</hi> and in caſe the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould deny to comply with their deſires, to force them to a Compoſition.</p>
                     <p>The High and Mighty States eaſily liſtned to this counſel, and Vice-Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> with a Potent Fleet was ſent to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> carrying with him ſome Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the States to make their demands, which the Queen Regent and Council thought ſo unreaſonable, that they could not return any ſatisfactory anſwer to them, whereupon the Commiſſioners departed: But <hi>Opdam</hi> ſtill ſtayed with his Fleet to wait an opportunity of catching the <hi>Brazil</hi> Fleet in their return home, many of which notwithſtanding the care and endeavors of the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> to prevent it, he made prize of, and ſent into <hi>Holland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this means was the War, which for many years had been maintained between the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> on the other ſide the Line, transferred to this ſide, which the King of <hi>France</hi> endeavoured by all means poſſible, before its eruption to prevent, and afterwards to compoſe by his Ambaſſadours, <hi>Monſieur de Thou</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Comings</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but to no Effect.</p>
                     <p>Thus aſſaulted by two potent Nations both by Sea and by Land were the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſſes,</hi> which yet made them not at all falter in their Courage and Reſolution; the generous Queen-Regent cauſing all poſſible Levies to be made to oppoſe the <hi>Caſtilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> ſending into <hi>Barbary</hi> to buy Horſes, and by Leagues abroad endeavouring to ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthen the intereſt of the Kingdom, an Ambaſſadour was ſent to that purpoſe into <hi>England,</hi> to renew and confirm the Amity before concluded on, and many Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there were between the Archbiſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> who had before been Ambaſſadour in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Comings;</hi> ſo that many were in hopes that the Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50649:76"/> the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta,</hi> would have gone forward, and an indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble League both defenſive and offenſive, been concluded between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>And to join Force to Policy, a gallant Army of about Sixteen thouſand Foot, and Three thouſand Horſe, all <hi>Portugueſſes,</hi> took the Field, and in Revenge for the loſs of <hi>Olivenza,</hi> laid ſiege to <hi>Mouron,</hi> which in Three or four dayes they took by ſtorm, putting Fifteen hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Sword, and reſolved to proceed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining of <hi>Badayox</hi> and <hi>Olivenza;</hi> and to that purpoſe marching without oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Caya</hi> (which they left fortified) they came to the Fort of St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> the ſtrongeſt hold of the City of <hi>Badayox,</hi> which they ſeveral dayes battered, and thrice ſtormed, but were beaten off; yet at the length they took it, and ſo ſecurely entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves about the whole City.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Oſſima,</hi> General of the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Horſe, having notice of this ſtrait ſiege of the City, endeavoured with Sixteen hundred Horſe to cut off their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes and Proviſions; but the <hi>Count del Prado,</hi> Governour of <hi>Elvas,</hi> receiving Advice of his Deſign, ſallied out of the City with Three Companies of Horſe, and all the Foot he had to prevent him, by which means <hi>Oſſima</hi> was encompaſſed on both ſides; for at the ſame time that he was on the other part charged by <hi>Don Andrea D'Albuquerque,</hi> General of the <hi>Portugueſſe</hi> Horſe, and that with ſo much Gallantry, that they preſently diſcomfited their Enemies, ſlew Four hundred upon the place, took Three hundred Priſoners, and forced the Duke of <hi>Oſſima</hi> to ſave himſelf by ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
                     <p>This happy Succeſs encouraged them to return with more Alacrity to the ſiege, which they proſecuted with all vigour poſſible, and on the Three and twentieth of <hi>June</hi> ſtormed, and took a Redoubt which was paliſadoſed; but at length when they had ſpent much time, blood, and treaſure, they were enforced by the powerful Army of <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> to raiſe their ſiege.</p>
                     <p>For the King of <hi>Spain</hi> exaſperated with the loſs of <hi>Mouron,</hi> and fearing likewiſe to loſe <hi>Badayox,</hi> had Rallied a great Army, which he committed to the Care of his Favourite <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> who not only with it raiſed the ſiege from before <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayox,</hi> but likewiſe ſo ſtraitly beſieged <hi>Elvas,</hi> one of the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> ſtrongeſt Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier-towns, the taking of which, might have endangered the whole Kingdom, and reduced it to ſuch Neceſſity, that it was even upon the point of yielding.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who knew of how much importance it was to them, had ever been anxious for its Relief, and therefore having at length bravely recruited their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they advanced with full Reſolution to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of their Trenches, nor did they effect it leſs bravely than they had reſolved it; for they totally Routed their General, <hi>Don Lewis de Haro</hi> very hardly eſcaping; but in this Battel the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez</hi> loſt the worthy <hi>Albuquerque</hi> General of the Horſe.</p>
                     <p>And to Counterpoiſe this Victory, the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Mounſon</hi> upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> was ſurrendred to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and a Party of the <hi>Portugals</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Advice that it was already poſſeſſed by the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> going to relieve it, were ſurprized, and forced ſhamefully to retreat with the loſs of ſome hundreds, and this Succeſs encouraged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under the Command of the Marqueſs of <hi>Viana,</hi> to beſiege the only City the <hi>Portugals</hi> were poſſeſt of on the River <hi>Minho,</hi> but it was relieved by the <hi>Portugals.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewiſe gained a ſignal Victory over a Party of <hi>Portugal</hi> Horſe nigh <hi>Alcantara;</hi> for Advice being brought to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of that Town, That the <hi>Portuguez</hi> with a Party of Four hundred Horſe were entring upon the Frontiers in two Bodies; he taking Five hundred Horſe, and a ſelect Party of Foot, went to meet them, and ſo handſomly managed his Buſineſs, that he ſurprized one whole Body, ſcarce a man eſcaping a Commiſſary General, five Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, and ſeveral other Officers being taken Priſoners.</p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:50649:76"/>
                     <p>But theſe things were inconſiderable Diſadvantages to the intereſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in reſpect of what it was like to feel by the Peace which was treating of between thoſe two mighty Monarchs of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which the Queen-Regent and Council were ſenſible of and therefore diſpatch <hi>Don John D'Acoſta</hi> Ambaſſadour Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the <hi>French</hi> Court, to repreſent unto his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty the ſtate of the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to inſiſt that there might be a due Conſideration had of the Intereſt of his Maſter in the concluding of the Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeeing he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly approved himſelf ſo good an Ally to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> But this Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie could produce no other Effect, than a promiſe to endeavour a Mediation for them with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and procure them good terms upon Submiſſion, which by the Magnanimous <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> was rejected with Indignation.</p>
                     <p>Nor were they at all Daunted with the great Power of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to employ againſt them, but Manfully reſolved to endure all Hazards; yet would they willingly have concluded a Peace with the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Don Fernando Tellez de Faro,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aveiro,</hi> was ſent Ambaſſadour to the <hi>States-General;</hi> but he like a treacherous Villain, revolted from them to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> carrying along with him the papers of his Ambaſſie; for which, according to his Deſert, his Effigies was executed at <hi>Lisbon</hi> as a Traytors, his Goods confiſcated, his Houſe razed to the ground, and his Children baniſhed, and degraded of Nobility, his Brother, <hi>Don Deigo De Sylva,</hi> who had ſerved the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> in the quality of General at Sea, was likewiſe upon this Occaſion commanded to retire to one of his Houſes, and deprived of all publick Employment.</p>
                     <p>After him was ſent <hi>Don Henry de Souſa</hi> Count of <hi>Miranda,</hi> to negotiate an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodation with the Netherland States, yet he prevailed little; for the pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Hollanders</hi> were ſtill reſolute in their unreaſonable demands, computing their loſſes in <hi>Brazil</hi> (where they had no right to be) to amount to no leſs than thirty millions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the mean time were forced to give the <hi>Portugals</hi> ſome reſpite in the ſummer, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and fifty nine,</hi> but preparations were made to aſſault them; with the whole power of that Monarchy in the Spring, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty,</hi> Don <hi>John D'Auſtria</hi> being called out of <hi>Flanders</hi> to be <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo</hi> of the Spaniſh Forces, and having Orders given him in <hi>April, One thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty,</hi> to march directly to <hi>Merida,</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Portugal,</hi> though he went not that Summer.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> reſolved not to be behind-hand with their Enemies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made ſeveral in-roads into the Spaniſh Territories, depopulating all before them, which made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be revenged, reſolve to do the like to them; Order was therefore given to fall into the Kingdom on all ſides, the Marqueſs of <hi>Viana</hi> Governor of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> marching in that way with Eight thouſand Foot, and eight hundred Horſe, and the Governor of <hi>Camara</hi> invading that part which was adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to his government.</p>
                     <p>In this condition was the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> when His Majeſty <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England,</hi> was reſtored to his Crowns and Kingdoms, welcomed by his Subjects with all gratulatory and ſubmiſſive Obedience; the News of which was no ſooner by advice from <hi>D. Franciſco de Melo,</hi> Ambaſſador for the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> conveyed to the ears of his Maſter, but he cauſed all the Guns of the Town, Caſtle, and Ships in the Road, to be fired, and for three days and nights kept ſolemn and magnificent Rejoycings; the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> Nation as well as by this their joy at the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, as by their ſorrow and general mourning at the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, expreſſing their great affection for the Engliſh Nation.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe their joy ſhould be ſomewhat for their own, as well as our ſakes,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50649:77"/> there at the ſame time arrived News at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> that Don <hi>Alphonſo Turtudo</hi> General of the Horſe, on the frontiers of <hi>Alentejo,</hi> meeting with a Brigade of the Enemies Horſe nigh to <hi>Bajadox,</hi> had fought and defeated them, killed and took four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them, amongſt whom were four Captains of Horſe priſoners.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill continued their Leavies againſt <hi>Portugal,</hi> being reſolved to employ an Army of four thouſand Horſe and twelve thouſand Foot conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited, about the Frontiers of <hi>Eſtramadura,</hi> and another of three thouſand Horſe, and ten thouſand Foot about <hi>Gallicia,</hi> and a third of twelve thouſand men, to ſerve as a Reſerve to the two former. In this manner were they reſolved to aſſault them by Land, while the Prince of <hi>Monteſarchio</hi> with ten men of War, was appointed to coaſt up and down before their Ports, and do them what miſchief he could by Sea.</p>
                     <p>Thus did this Kingdom ſtruggle with <hi>Spain</hi> for her Liberty, by the prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs, by that ſage and induſtrious Queen-Regent, until this preſent year, <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred threeſcore and two;</hi> when upon the Ninteenth of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> the <hi>Caſtillian</hi> Army marched towards the Towns of <hi>Barbeiſus</hi> and <hi>Choſaes;</hi> whereupon the General of the ſaid Province the Earle of <hi>Prado,</hi> and the Earle of St. <hi>John</hi> General of the Horſe, with all the Force they could make, did ſet forth to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Enemy, who being ſurprized by the Care of the ſaid General, did engage, with the Approbation of the chief Commander <hi>Don Balthaſar Pontaju,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately commanded them to fall on; but the Earle of <hi>Prado</hi> did as well receive them, he deſiring nothing elſe but to ſhew the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> how little they did value them. The Fight began with a great deal of Reſolution on the Enemies ſide, who for many houres hotly diſputed the Quarrel, till wearied by the unwearied Courage of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſſes,</hi> their whole Army was forced to flie in great Diſorder. A conſiderable number of the Enemies were ſlain, and many taken Priſoners, by which the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was freed from the Enemy with great Satisfaction to the Crown, and great Honour to the Count of <hi>Prado,</hi> whoſe Prudence and Valour in the management of this Buſineſs was much commended.</p>
                     <p>In the Province of <hi>Beira</hi> no leſs Succeſs ſmiled upon the <hi>Portugueſses,</hi> by the Count of <hi>Villaflor</hi> Governour thereof, and the General of the Horſe <hi>Manuel Treire D'Andrada,</hi> who having intelligence that the Duke of <hi>Oſſana</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Eſcalas,</hi> and raiſed a conſiderable Fort upon it with ſeveral Guns, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Four hundred men to defend it, went out, and giving Battel to the Duke, put him to Flight, killing about Six hundred men, and taking the greateſt part of his Baggage, with all his Ordnance; and then falling upon the ſaid Fort, in few houres took it (at mercy) to the aſtoniſhment of the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> who fully perceived that they were not able to Act any thing againſt the ſame Provinces, being ſo nobly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſame Governour, and the People ſo unanimous to oppoſe them.</p>
                     <p>Nor had the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> gained thoſe Advantages in <hi>Alentejo,</hi> had it not been for the Civil Diſſentions and Animoſities among the <hi>Portugal</hi> Colonels, which ſince have been ſufficiently provided againſt by the Care of the Miniſters of State, and eſpecially by the Prudence of <hi>Don Antonio De Souſa</hi> of <hi>Macedo,</hi> now principal Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, heretofore Reſident from the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If that the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> have thus long, and ſo valiantly defended themſelves by their own proper Valour, without a Forreign Aſſiſtance, againſt ſo potent a Monarch as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> then how much more now will they be able, ſince they have renewed the old League with <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Forces being united, may defie all thoſe that ſhall oppoſe them, both Kingdoms being moſt formidable at Sea, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of a potent Army.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> unmindful of returning the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> an Acknowledgment for the Happineſs His Majeſty received from Him, in the Perſon of His Siſter, that Royal Lady the Princeſs KATHERINE, when He ſent Supplies into
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50649:77"/> that Kingdom under the Command of that Valiant Lord the Earle of <hi>Inchequeen,</hi> almoſt as ſoon as His Majeſty had the Aſſurance of receiving His Beautiful Queen into His own Arms, ſuch was His MAJESTIES Care of the Welfare of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the Knot of a perpetual Alliance being now ſo firmly tied, That maugre all the Oppoſition of the moſt malignant Oppoſers, They are reſolved to link their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns together ever hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Since the Arrival of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces in <hi>Portugal,</hi> there hath been little Action, they having been diſpoſed of into Three ſeveral Squadrons; ſo that now in <hi>September</hi> laſt, the Generals all returned to <hi>Lisbon</hi> to refreſh themſelves, there being no further Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the Field. <hi>Don John</hi>'s Army had Orders ſent them not to march, and the other Two, ſince the late Defeats given them, have been in no Capacity of doing the leaſt Injury, <hi>Portugal</hi> being now free from the Noiſe of the <hi>Castillians</hi> both by Sea and Land. <hi>Don John</hi> was lately at <hi>Badayos,</hi> (having for a while laid all thoughts of farther Action aſide) where he muſtered all the Forces, and drew them into their Winter-quarters. In the mean time, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent Orders to ſeveral Places to make great preparation againſt the next Spring; ſo that marching in with more Force, they may give a better Account than they have of this years Expedition.</p>
                     <p>King ALPHONSO VI. entring now upon the Twentieth year of His Age, lately took the Reins of the Government into His own Hand, and hath ſate for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice in Criminal Cauſes, where a Judge, and Secretary of the Court of Orphans, were brought before Him, and Accuſed for having dealt unjuſtly in the managery of their Truſt. His MAJESTY was pleaſed with much Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to attend the whole Tryal, where it being fully proved, That according to the Charge exhibited againſt them, they had wronged ſeveral Orphans, and dealt unjuſtly in the Diſpoſal of their Goods; Sentence was pronounced upon them both, the Judge to be beheaded, and the Secretary to be hanged. I mention this, only to let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der know how much this Action of the Kings hath encreaſed the Eſteem and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which His MAJESTIES Subjects had for Him; That at His firſt ſitting in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, He ſhould ſo far encourage the Cauſes of His weaker People, as not to ſpare Offenders, though of the greateſt Quality; but to ſee Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation paſſed againſt thoſe that injure them.</p>
                     <p>Thus have you an Account of the Lives and Iſſues of the KINGS of PORTUGAL, from the Foundation of that Monarchy, to the Sixth year of the Reign of KING ALPHONSO VI. being this preſent year, 1662. leaving that KINGDOM in an aſſured Confidence, That ENGLAND will prove (as it hath ever been) a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bulwark to them, than any other their Confederates.</p>

                           <p>Nor was the deteſtation of the Arch-duke <hi>Leopold</hi> to an act ſo ſoul and ſhameful, leſs than that of his brothers the Emperour; notwithſtanding all which, <hi>Mello</hi> was not at all diſcouraged, but ſtill proſecuted his villanous deſign, by corrupting with great ſums of money the Count of <hi>Tratſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf,</hi> and ſeveral other Penſioners of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> but they were ſoon weary of ſo baſe and ſhameful an employment; which made <hi>Mello</hi> think of a more cunning Artifice, which was to perſwade the Emperour to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the allurements of one <hi>Diego di Quiroga,</hi> who of a Souldier was turned Monk, and was now Confeſſor to the Empreſs: This Father who had often been called to give his judgement in Affairs of State, endeavored by all means poſſible to perſwade the Emperour that he might not only with a good conſcience ſecure the Infante, but that according to the beſt Rules of Intereſt of State, he ought to do it.</p>
                           <p>His Imperial Majeſty notwithſtanding all theſe perſwaſions, was very much unſatisfied in the action, and once fully reſolved not to do it; but at length overcome by <hi>Mello</hi>'s importunities, and the Ghoſtly perſwaſions of <hi>Quiroga,</hi> he was as it were conſtrained to alter his reſolution, and to give order to <hi>Don Lewis Gonzaga,</hi> to go to the Princes quarters at <hi>Leipen,</hi> and ſummon him to <hi>Ratisbone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the mean time to endeavor to prevent all ill impreſſions, which an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo hainouſly wicked, might ſtrike into all boſoms that had either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or honeſty; it was given out abroad, that the Infante <hi>Don Edward</hi> was ſecretly fled for ſome miſdemeanor from <hi>Leipen,</hi> (when he confident of his own innocency, was in his journey to <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> according to the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) and thereupon propoſal made of Sixteen thouſand Crowns, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to any man could bring him either dead or alive; ſo that the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of any ſuch thing, very hardly eſcaped their hands,<note place="margin">

                              </note> who out of hopes of the money, had gone in ſearch of him; but miſſing them, he came to <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> where he was no ſooner received, but without any reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he was caſt into a Common Goal, and all his Servants impriſoned.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Don Franciſco de Mello</hi> having thus far brought his deſires to effect, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not here, but afreſh ſollicited the Emperour, that the Prince might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands, and ſent priſoner to <hi>Millain:</hi> but inſtead of aſſenting to this, he ſends a Meſſenger to the Infante, aſſuring him upon his word, that he would not deliver him into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but would ſpeedily procure his liberty and infranchiſement.</p>
                           <p>Yet notwithſtanding theſe fair promiſes of the Emperours, <hi>Don Edward</hi>'s ill uſage in priſon daily and hourly increaſed, nor could he by any means poſſible get audience of the Emperour, not without reaſon, for, <hi>No face is more terrible to the offendor, than the face offended;</hi> which made the Prince make his proteſtation, calling God and man to witneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done him by the Emperour, to whom he was neither ſubject by Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, nor Birth; that when his brother was made King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he was in the Emperours ſervice, and wholly ignorant of any deſign of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> were offended, he ſhould revenge himſelf upon the perſon offending; that that buſineſs no way concerned the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>All theſe Allegations the Emperour confeſſed to be true, by a Meſſenger ſent to the Infante in priſon, again aſſuring him that he would not deliver him up to his enemies, but that he could not releaſe him for ſome reaſon of State: which made <hi>Don Franciſco de Soſa Contigno,</hi> Ambaſſadour extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary from <hi>Portugal</hi> to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in the name of the King his

                           <p>But hitherto the Emperour ſeemed immoveable in his reſolution of not delivering up the Infante into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> till tempted with what made <hi>Judas</hi> betray his Maſter, and our bleſſed Saviour to death, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> he conſented to the breach of his reſolve, for upon the promiſe of Forty thouſand Crowns (contrary to the immunities of the Empire, to the Priviledges of Free Princes, to the Law of Nations, and to his Word and Promiſe ſo often reiterated) he conſented that that Noble and Innocent Prince ſhould be ſent whither the Catholique King ſhould think fit; ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he was hurried towards the Caſtle of <hi>Millain,</hi> there to remain a priſoner.</p>
                           <p>By the way as he entred into the Spaniſh Territories, he was received by the Count <hi>de Sirnela</hi> Governour of that Dukedom, where the Emperours Commiſſary took leave to return, to whom <hi>D. Edward</hi> openly ſaid, <hi>Tell thy Maſter, that I am more ſorry I have ſerved ſo unworthy a Prince, than to ſee my ſelf ſold a Priſoner into the hands of my enemies; but the just Judge of the world will one day ſuffer the like dealing towards his children, who are no more priviledged for being of the houſe of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>than my ſelf that am of the Blood-Royal of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and Poſterity will judge of him and me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Emperour had given inſtruction to thoſe that Convoyed the Infante, that in caſe their priſoner made an attempt to eſcape, they ſhould kill him upon the place: being arrived in <hi>Millain</hi> he was clapt in the Common gate with all the Rogues and <hi>Banditty,</hi> having a Guard lodged with him in his Chamber, ſo rude, that they would ſcarce admit him to take his reſt; in which Priſon he moſt miſerably dyed,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> upon the Third day of <hi>September,</hi> in <label type="milestone">
